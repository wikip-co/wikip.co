## Description

Short food suuply chains (SFSCs) refer to a broad range of food production-distribution-consumption configurations.

## Examples

### Farmers' markets

###  Farm shops

### Collective farmers' shops

### Community-supported agriculture (CSA model)

Also known as cropsharing, the CSA model is a system that allows consumers to directly subscribe to the harvest of a certain farm or group of farms.

The CSA model is commonly employed using the vegetable box scheme.

- A vegetable box scheme is an operation that delivers fresh fruits and vegetables, often locally grown and organic, either directly to the customer or to a local collection point.  This service is typically sold as an ongoing weekly subscription, varying week to week depending on what is in season.
