**Cordyceps** is a genus of ascomycete fungi (sac fungi) that includes about 400 species. Most Cordyceps species are endoparasitoids, parasitic mainly on insects and other arthropods (they are thus entomopathogenic fungi); a few are parasitic on other fungi. The generic name Cordyceps is derived from the Greek word κορδύλη kordýlē, meaning "club", and the Greek word κεφαλή cephali, meaning "head".

## Healing Properties

### Immune System Modulator

Cordyceps Supplementation has shown positive effects on immune response. Supplementation over 12 weeks showed significantly higher Natural killer<sup>*</sup> (NK) cell activity and Immunoglobulin A levels (an antibody blood protein) compared to the placebo group. These results suggest the possible beneficial immunomodulating effects.[^1]

> <sup>*</sup> Natural killer cells are a type of lymphocyte critical to the innate immune system. The role of NK cells is analogous to that of T cells in the adaptive immune response. NK cells provide rapid responses to virus-infected cells, acting at around 3 days after infection, and respond to tumor formation.
