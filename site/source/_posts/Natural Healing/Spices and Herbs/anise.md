**Anise** (Pimpinella anisum), also called aniseed, is a flowering plant in the family Apiaceae native to the eastern Mediterranean region and Southwest Asia. Its flavor has similarities with some other spices, such as star anise, fennel, and liquorice.

## Composition

Anise contains an abundant concentration of flavonoids.  Phytochemical studies on anise extracts have indicated the presence of various proteins, tannins, glycosides and fixed oils.[^3]

- The major constituents of anise essential oil are anethole, γ-himachalene, cis-isoeugenol and linalool.[^4]

## Healing Properties

### Analgesic

Pimpinella anisum exhibits significant analgesic activities.

- The analgesic effect of Anise essential oil was reported to be similar to morphine and aspirin.[^4]

#### Anesthetic

Compounds of Anise oil, such as eugenol and estragole, have anesthetic properties.[^4]

### Anti-Diabetic effect

Administration of anise oil reduced serum levels of glucose.[^2]

### Antiinflammatory 

### Antioxidant

The anise plant has strong antioxidant activity with the potential to prevent the damage caused by oxidizing agents produced in the body (free radical scavenging activity).[^3]

### Antimicrobial

#### Antifungal

Studies have scientifically proved the antimicrobial and antifungal activities of anise.[^3]

#### Antiviral

### Digestion

Anise oil has a positive effect on the digestion of food. This effect may be attributed to the active compounds of anise such as anethole, eugenol, anisaldehyde, estragol and methylchavicol, which have a special tonic effect on the digestive system.[^2]

#### Anti-Ulcer

### Neuroprotective

Anise provides neuro-protection by preventing oxidative stress in the brain.[^3]

#### Anti-Epileptic

Compounds of Anise oil, such as eugenol and estragole, have anti-epileptic properties.[^4] Previous studies well demonstrated anticonvulsant activity of eugenol and estragole in Anise oil.[^4]

#### Behavioral Health

##### GABA receptors

Studies have reported that anise oil may cause activation of the GABA receptors.[^4]

##### Learning

Anise can enhance the brain's ability to learn new activities and help retain learned skills:

- Aqueous extract of anise reduced the transfer latencies (measuring how long it takes for a behavior to begin after a specific verbal demand or event has occurred) which is an indication of improvement in learned activity.[^3]
- Aqueous extract of anise resulted in higher inflexion ratio (a parameter used to find the retention of learned skills).[^3]

##### Memory

Aqueous extract of Anise improves memory both by preventing oxidative stress and by providing neuro-protection.[^3]

##### Spatial Learning 

Administration of P. anisum essential oil resulted in an improvement of learning performance and spatial memory.[^1]

### Muscle Relaxer

Compounds of Anise oil, such as eugenol and estragole, have muscle relaxant properties.[^4]

## Disease / Symptom Treatment

### Dementia

Dementia is a group of symptoms characterized by progressive loss of memory, cognition impairment and decline in overall routine performance.

- Aqueous extract of Anise improves memory both by preventing oxidative stress and by providing neuro-protection.[^3]

### Diabetes

#### Hyperglycemia

- Anise Oil prevents hyperglycemia thereby significantly decreasing lipid peroxidation (a marker of oxidative stress in erythrocytes and plasma).[^2]
- Anise Oil decreases glucose levels indicating control over oxidative stress as hyperglycemia can directly cause increased generation  of reactive oxygen species as glucose undergoes auto-oxidation and generate OH radicals. In addition, glucose reacts with proteins in a non-enzymatic manner leading to the development of amadori products followed by formation ofAdvanced Glycation Endproducts.[^2]

### Headaches

### Cholesterol

#### Hyperlipidemia

Hyperlipidemia means your blood has too many lipids (fats), such as cholesterol and triglycerides. One type of hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, means there's too much LDL cholesterol in your blood.

- Anise oil led to a significant decrease in the level of cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL-c levels.[^2]
  - The mechanism by which anise oil ameliorates cholesterol, triglyceride and  LDL-c are its antioxidant properties and radical scavenging activity.[^2]
    - The polyphenols present in the anise oil could donate electrons and react with free radicals to convert them into stable products and terminate the free radical chain whereas other compounds in the oil act as chain-breaking agents in lipid peroxidation.[^2]

### Menopause

#### Hot Flashes

### Menstrual Cramps (Dysmenorrhea)

### Mercury Poisoning

Treatment with Pimpinella anisum essential oil could improve learning disabilities associated with mercury exposure during the developmental period. P. anisum essential oil resulted into an improvement of learning performance and reduction of mercury in the blood and brain mercury.[^1]

### Migraine headaches

Of all the compounds in anise oil, anethole may have the most important role in the treatment of migraine attacks.[^4]  Anethole has a similar structure to dopamine.  Therefore it is postulated that anethole acts as an antagonist of dopamine in binding to the dopamine receptors. Due to the role of dopamine in inducing migraine attacks, it is proposed that the use of a dopamine antagonist could also block the chain of migraine attack cascade.[^4]

There are neuro-physiological similarities between migraines and epilepsy, therefore some antiepileptic therapies are used to treat migraines.[^4]  Compounds of Anise oil, such as eugenol and estragole, have anesthetic, muscle relaxant and anti-epileptic properties which could help relieve migraine headaches.[^4]

Another hypothesis proposed to stop migraine attacks is activation of the GABA pathway. The plasma levels of GABA are not detectable during a migraine attack, however, the levels increase after the migraine event is over.  Anise oil may cause activation of the GABA receptors.[^4]  Therefore, GABA pathway activation may be another mechanism of action of anise oil in preventing or stopping migraine attacks.[^4]

## Adverse Affects

### Phytoestrogen

Phytoestrogens are plant derived compounds which have estrogenic effects similar to estrogen. Phytoestrogens is an estrogenic agent, directly or indirectly interfering with the physiological effect of estrogens and interfere with the function of male reproductive system.[^2]

The main active ingredient of the anise oil, anethole, has been considered as the active estrogenic agent. Anise oil also  contain safrol, which lowers the level of androgen and leads to hormonal disturbance and decrease sperm count. Furthermore,  it has been suggested that estrogen exposure interferes with the androgen receptor pathway and affect the late steps of spermatogenesis. According to the traditional thinking, drinking anise by boys may be harmful to their reproductive system.[^2]

- High levels of anise intake have been shown to cause hormonal disturbances in males and decrease sperm count.[^2]
  - Decrease in Follicle stimulating hormone.
  - Decrease in Luteinizing hormone.
  - Decrease in testosterone.

- Safrol is toxic in a concentration of 1% of the diet, producing weight loss, testicular atrophy, bone marrow depletion and also produces tumors in two-thirds of the animals treated with it.

### Weight Gain

- Anise oil consumption led to an increase in body weight.[^2]
  - One of the active compounds of anise, Anethole, is also the main compound in pathogenic microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract where it showed an increasing effect on weight gain (body weight).[^2]

This study was aimed to test, in vivo, effect of exposition to mercury chloride (100mg/L) in wistar rats during the gestation and lactation period. On the other hand, treatment of pups with essential oil of P. anisum (0.25 ml/kg) for 21 days. The behavioural patterms evaluated was spatial memory ( Morris water maze) and the determination of mercury concentration in blood and brain. The data were analysed by two way analyses of variance (ANOVAs). When a significant difference was found, the Student Newman Keuls post hoc test was conducted. The results of the present study demonstrated that exposure to mercury in developmental period induced, significantly decrease of the learning performance (p < 0.01; p < 0.05) compared to control rats. Thus, the concentration of mercury in the intoxicated group is high in the blood and brain. However, the administration of P. anisum essential oil resulted into an improvement of learning perfor-mance (p< 0.01; p< 0.05) and reduction of mercury blood and brain mercury. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that mercury exposure during the developmental period induces learning disabilities and remains trapped in blood and brain. This could be improved by the treatment with Pimpinella anisum essential oil.</i><br>**Link:** [Source](http://sajeb.org/index.php/sajeb/article/viewArticle/20578)<br>**Citations:**

Aqueous (aqP.a) and n-hexane (nhP.a) fractions of crude Anise extracts were 1st investigated for phytochemical and antioxidant analysis and then administered to mice for behavioral (by usingelevated plus maze (EPM), light dark test and hole board paradigms) and biochemical investigations. Flavonoids, tannins and phenols were found to be 127.43 ± 1.94, 201.04 ± 1.57 and 209.83 ± 1.30 mg/g, respectively for aqP.aand 125.33 ±2.18,  74.66  ±  1.20  and  42.87  ±  1.65  mg/g,  respectively  for  nhP.a.  Values  of  IC50were  recorded  as  37.48  and  166.53μg/ml for aqP.a and nhP.a respectively. Moreover, aqP.a significantly(P < 0.001)improved inflexion ratios in EPM test and  biochemical  parameters  like  glutathiones,  catalases  and  superoxide  dismutases.  The  levels of  acetylcholinesterase(AChE)  and  malondialdehyde  (MDA)  were  significantly(P  <  0.001)reduced  by  aqP.a  as  compared  to  nhP.a.  The findings thus suggested that only aqueous extract of Anise improves memory both by preventing oxidative stress and by providing neuroprotection to cholinergic pathways against AChE.</i><br>**Link:** [Source](http://www.thejaps.org.pk/docs/Accepted/2019/29-02/26.pdf)<br>**Citations:**

It is one of the frequent complaints encountered by neurologists in daily practice. Previous reports showed migraine affects up to 12 percent of the general population(Lipton et al., 2001).Although several treatments have been proposed for the treatment of migraine, it is still not completely manageable. Hence, patients are usually looking for herbal remedies to control migraines (Jivad et al., 2016). Anise (Pimpinella anisum L.) which belongs to the Apiaceae family is one of the oldest medicinal herbs and widely used spice plants. Anise components are used in perfumery, food and cosmetic industries. Previous studies showed that Anise have a variety of biological activities(Miething et al., 1990).Aniseeds have a variety of properties such as antifungal, antiviral, antimicrobial, antioxidant, muscle relaxant, anticonvulsant and analgesic. It also has good effects on diseases like diabetes, hyperlipidemia, dysmenorrhea, hot flash and gastrointestinal diseases(Shojaii and Abdollahi Fard, 2012). In traditional medicine, Anise has been used as analgesic, appetizer, sedative, expectorant, carminative hepatoprotective, galactagogue, and disinfectant(Aiswarya et al., 2018). Moreover in several Persian medicine resources, such as Liber continens of Rhazes (865-925 AD) (Hashempur et al., 2017), Canon of Medicine by Avicenna (980-1037 AD)(Mosavat et al., 2017) , and the Storehouse of Medicaments written by Aghili Shirazi (1670–1747 AD) (Shakeri et al., 2018), Anise oil has been used for management of various neurological diseases, including headache and; it is also believed to have neuroprotective effects (Gorji and Khaleghi Ghadiri, 2001; Zargari, 1995; Shojaii and Abdollahi Fard, 2012). Regarding the traditional use of Anise (Pimpinella anisum L.) as well as its known favorable effects in current studies, we decided to design a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of topical anise essential oil in management of patients with migraine headache.</i><br>**Link:** [Source](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2019.01.047)<br>**Citations:**
