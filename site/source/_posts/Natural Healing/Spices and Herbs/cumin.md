**Cumin** (Cuminum cyminum) is a flowering plant in the parsley family which produces a fruit that contains aromatic seeds which are dried and used as a spice, they are usually ground into a powder and used in curry.

## Biological Properties

### Anti-Aflatoxigenic

### Anticancer

#### Chemopreventive

C. cyminum fruits reduce the risk of, or delay the development or recurrence of, cancer.[^2]

### Antioxidant

Cuminum cyminum L. essential oil supplementation can improve some antioxidative indices in the body.[^1]

### Antiinflammatory

Cuminum cyminum L. essential oil supplementation increased superoxide dismutase (a very important antioxidant defense in the body) and total antioxidant capacity while decreasing malondialdehyde (a highly reactive compound that is a marker for oxidative stress).[^1]

### Weight Loss

### Lipid Profile

Cumin has been shown to have a beneficial effect on lipid profile.[^1]

## Disease / Symptom Treatment

### Fungal Pathogens

#### Candida

#### Aflatoxin

### Obesity

Cumin powder (along with a weight reduction diet) showed improvement in anthropometric and biochemical parameters in overweight/obese women.[^1]

- Cumin powder significantly reduced weight, BMI, waist circumference, fat mass and its percentage.[^1]

### Hypercholesterolemia

Cumin powder reduced serum levels of fasting cholesterol, triglyceride, and LDL and increased HDL.[^1]

### Cancer

#### Breast Cancer

Flavonoids especially luteolin-7-O-glucoside play a significant role in cytotoxic effect of C. cyminum fruits and can be introduced as candidate for chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic drugs.[^2]
