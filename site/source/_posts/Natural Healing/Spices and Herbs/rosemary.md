**Rosemary** is a woody, perennial herb with fragrant, evergreen, needle-like leaves and white, pink, purple, or blue flowers, native to the Mediterranean region. The plant can live as long as 30 years.

**Scientific Name:** Salvia rosmarinus.  Until 2017, it was known by the scientific name Rosmarinus officinalis.

## Composition

Rosemary contains a number of phytochemicals, including rosmarinic acid, camphor, caffeic acid, ursolic acid, betulinic acid, carnosic acid, and carnosol. Rosemary essential oil contains 10–20% camphor.

- The rosemary contains the polyphenols carnosic acid (CA), rosmarinic acid (RA), and carnosol (COH) in high concentrations.[^4]

## Healing Properties

### Antimicrobial

(anti-microbial)

#### Antibiolm activity

### Antiepileptic

anticonvulsant activity against seizures.[^1]

### Antimutagenic

> Antimutagens are agents that protect DNA from harmful mutations.

### Anticancer

#### Pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative

- Rosemary Extract has potent effects against prostate cancer.[^4]
    - Treatment of prostate cancer cells with Rosemary Extract resulted in a significant inhibition of proliferation, survival, migration, and tumor cell signaling. 
    - Treatment of prostate cancer cells with Rosemary Extract resulted in a significant inhibition of proliferation and survival.
    - Normal prostate epithelial cells remained unaffected by Rosemary Extract treatment.

### Antioxidant

### Antiparkinson’s

The compound carnosol (from Rosemary) significantly protected brain cells from neurotoxicity and improved the cell viability.

### Antidepressant

Involvement of GABAA receptors has been explained as a possible mode of action for inhibition.[^1]

### Anxiolytic

(anti-anxiety)

### Carminative

(relieves flatulence)

### Circulatory Stimulant

### Healthy Digestion

### Nervine

used to stimulate/relax the nerves.

### Brain Health

#### Mental Stimulation

**Stimulant:** Three compounds (cirsimaritin, rosmanol and salvigenin) demonstrated central nervous system stimulant activity.[^1]

#### Memory enhancer** 

(nootropic)

#### Neuroprotective

Rosemary leaf extract improves tolerance against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (tissue damage caused when blood supply returns to the brain tissue after a period of ischemia or lack of oxygen).[^1]

### Metabolism

Rosemary Extract improves metabolic abnormalities

Carnosic acid (CA), a major constituent of rosemary extract, has been shown to improve metabolic abnormalities. Three doses decreased body weight gain, decreased changes in lipid profile (due to increased food intake), improved Fasting Blood Glucose levels, leptin level, and mean systolic blood pressure (MSBP). Overall helped regulate glucose hemostasis in the liver.[^3]

### Skin Health

## Disease / Symptom Treatment

### Cancer

#### Prostate Cancer

- Rosemary Extract has potent effects against prostate cancer.[^4]
    - Treatment of prostate cancer cells with Rosemary Extract resulted in a significant inhibition of proliferation, survival, migration, and tumor cell signaling. 
    - Treatment of prostate cancer cells with Rosemary Extract resulted in a significant inhibition of proliferation and survival while Rosemary Extract had no effect on normal prostate epithelial cells.

### Diabetes

Rosemary Extract improves metabolic abnormalities

Carnosic acid (CA), a major constituent of rosemary extract, has been shown to improve metabolic abnormalities. Three doses decreased body weight gain, decreased changes in lipid profile (due to increased food intake), improved Fasting Blood Glucose levels, leptin level, and mean systolic blood pressure (MSBP). Overall helped regulate glucose hemostasis in the liver.[^3]
