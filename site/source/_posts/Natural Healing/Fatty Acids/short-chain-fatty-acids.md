**Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFA)** are a postbiotic fermentation product of non-digestible dietary fiber by microbiota in the intestine.

Highly-fermentable fiber residues are transformed by colonic bacteria into short-chain fatty acids.

## Healing Properties

### Antiinflammatory

SCFA have anti-inflammatory properties.[^1]

### Pulmonary Health

Dietary fibre is protective against features COPD, mediated in part by facilitating the production of SCFA by the gastrointestinal microbiota.[^1] [^2]

#### Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)

The SCFAs produced from dietary fiber have been found to protect against COPD.[^1] [^2]

### Microbiome Modulation

### Immunomodulator

SCFA have immune modulatory properties[^1]

## Disease / Symptom Treatment

### Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)

The SCFAs produced from dietary fiber have been found to protect against COPD.[^1]
