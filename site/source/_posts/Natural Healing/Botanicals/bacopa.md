## Description

**Bacopa** (Bacopa monnieri L.) is also known as thyme-leaved Gratiola or water hyssop (Waterhyssop). Bacopa has been used for augmentation of learning, memory, and brain health for thousands of years.

## Composition

Standardized extract of Bacopa monnieri contains at least 55% bacosides.

## Healing Properties

### Adaptogenic Activity (adaptogen)

High doses of standardized extract of B. monniera significantly reversed chronic stress-induced changes in ulcer index and adrenal gland weight.[^1]

### Anti-Aging

Bacopa has strong potential for safely enhancing cognitive performance in ageing.[^1]

### Anti-Cancer

Bacopaside II, an extract from the medicinal herb Bacopa monnieri. has promising anti-cancer activity for the treatment of colorectal and other cancers.[^2]

- Bacopaside II inhibits colon cancer cell growth by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.[^2]
- Bacopaside II inhibits migration of colon cancer cells. [^2]

### Antidepressant

Methanolic extract of B. monnieri given once daily for 5 days showed significant antidepressant activity.[^1]

### Cognition-Enhancing (Nootropic)

- Alcoholic extract of B. monnieri improves the performance in various learning situations.[^1]
- Bacosides enhance the protein kinase activity in the hippocampus which could be contributing factor to the nootropic activity.
- Several randomized, controlled human clinical trials have proved the cognition-enhancing and nootropic effects of Bacopa.[^1]
- Researchers have suggested that bacosides cause membrane dephosphorylation, with a conjoined increase in protein and RNA turnover in specific brain areas.

#### Learning

- Treatment with the ethanolic extract of B. monnieri showed enhanced learning ability.
- Bacosides A and B have facilitatory effect on mental retention capacity as they tend to improve responses with positive and negative reinforcement.

#### Memory

The memory augmenting effect of BM is well documented.

- B. monnieri decreases the rate of forgetting of newly acquired information.[^1]
- Chronic use of Bacopa has been shown to result in improved higher-order cognitive processes that are dependent on learning and memory.[^1]

#### Neuroprotective

B. monniera has been reported to have protective effect from phenytoin-induced cognitive deficit.[^1]

- Extract of B. monniera (40 mg/kg/day) prevents lipid accumulation and protein damage caused by aluminium intake.
- Bacopa monnieri demonstrated neuroprotective activity on beta-amyloid-induced cell death.[^1]

### Male reproductive health

#### Spermatogenesis

Treatment with standardized extract of Bacopa monnieri improves sperm quality, and spermatogenic cell density and steroidogenic indices in the testis.[^3]

- Treatment with standardized extract of Bacopa monnieri for 28 days caused:[^3]
  - A significant increase in:
    - Spermatogenic cell density (increases were noted in germinal epithelial height and tubular diameter).
    - Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) index (a useful marker for assessing germ cell kinetics and spermatogenesis).[^4]
    - Steroidogenic indices in the testis (enzyme activity)
    - Sperm viability in cauda epididymis (sperm that is being held "in storage" within the epididymis).
  - This same treatment caused a significant decrease in:
    - Abnormal sperm morphology in cauda epididymidis.[^3]
    - Lipid peroxidation levels in testis (oxidative degradation of lipids, cell damage).

## Disease / Symptom Treatment

### Amnesia

Bacopa monniera extract demonstrated anti-amnesic effects.[^1]

### Anxiety

A daily dose of 12 g of Bacopa syrup showed significant improvements in anxiety concentration and memory in patients suffering from anxiety neurosis.[^1]

### Attention-Deficit Disorder

(ADD) Alcoholic extract of Bacopa, administered to children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, demonstrated significant improvement in the areas of sentence repetition, logical memory, and pair associative learning.[^1]

### Cancer

Bacopaside IIshows promising anti-cancer activity for the treatment of colorectal and other cancers.[^2]

### Depression

### Epilepsy

Bacoside A has been shown to ameliorate epilepsy-associated behavioural deficits.[^1]

### Morphine dependence

N-Butanolic extract of B. monnieri containing bacoside A (bacoside A3, bacopaside II and bacopasaponin C) has been shown to reduce morphine hyperactivity and the elevated striatal dopamine and serotonin turnover.[^1]

### Neurodegenerative Diseases

Extract of Bacopa monniera has been reported to improve cognition in old-age people and in patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases.[^1]

#### Alzheimer's

- Bacopa monnieri demonstrated neuroprotective activity on beta-amyloid-induced cell death.[^1]
