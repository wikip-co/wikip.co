**Ashwagandha** (Withania somnifera) is a plant in the Solanaceae or nightshade family.

Also known as Indian ginseng, poison gooseberry, or winter cherry,

## Composition

The green berries contain amino acids, a proteolytic enzyme, condensed tannins, and flavonoids. They contain a high proportion of free amino acids which include proline, valine, tyrosine, alanine, glycine, hydroxyproline, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, cystine and cysteine. The presence of a proteolytic enzyme, chamase, in the berries may be responsible for the high content of the amino acid.[^1]

## Healing Properties

### Adaptogen

### Antiinflammatory

### Antimicrobial

The antibiotic activity of the roots as well as leaves has recently been shown experimentally.[^1]

#### Antibiotic (Antibacterial)

Withania somnifera in concentration of 10g/ml inhibited the growth of various Gram-positive bacteria, acid-fast and
aerobic bacilli, and pathogenic fungi.[^1]

- It was active against Micrococcus pyogenes var aureus and partially inhibited the activity of Bacillus subtilis glucose-6-phosphatedehydrogenase.[^1]
