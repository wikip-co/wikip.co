### Fibromyalgia / Idiopathic myalgic pain

Pycnogenol supplementation appears to control and reduce the intensity of common symptoms and complaints - especially pain-related - associated with Fibromyalgia.[^1]

Pycnogenol could be a 'soft', safe supplementation and prevention method to manage the symptoms of most fibromyalgia patients, even for longer periods, reducing the need for other drugs.[^1]
