**Chinese skullcap** (Scutellaria baicalensis) also known as Baikal skullcap, is a species of flowering plant in the mint family.

## Composition

- Flavons (a type of flavonoid)
  - Baicalein is one of Chinese skullcap's active ingredients.
  - Baicalin
  - Wogonin

## Healing Properties

### Antimicrobial

#### Antibacterial

#### Antiviral

### Anticancer

### Anti‑diarrheal

### Oral Health

## Disease / Symptom Treatment

### Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)

### Fever

### Diarrhea

Wogonin, an active ingredient in Chinese skullcap, was effective in inhibiting colonic motility, probably through the opening of KCa channels located in the smooth muscle apparatus. These findings suggest that wogonin may be a candidate drug for the management of dysmotility‑related diarrhea.[^1]

### Periodontal infections

(Periodontopathic Bacteria) Chinese Skullcap was shown to inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacterium associated with Gingivitis, Periodontitis, Acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis, localized aggressive periodontitis, severe infection of the periodontium, and chronic periodontitis.[^2]

### Ulcerative colitis

A polysaccharide isolated from Chinese Skullcap (Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi) has been shown to ameliorate colitis.[^3]

- Oral administration of the chinese skullcap polysaccharide significantly decreased the colitis disease activity index.[^3]
- The chinese skullcap polysaccharide ameliorated colonic pathological damage.[^3]
- The polysaccharide markedly suppressed the proinflammatory cytokines in the serum and colon.[^3]
- The SP1-1 polysaccharide isolated from chinese skullcap has been recommended as a novel drug candidate in the treatment of colitis.[^3]
