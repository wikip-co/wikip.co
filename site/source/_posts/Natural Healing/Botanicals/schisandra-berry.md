**Schisandra berry** (Schisandra chinensis) is also called the magnolia berry or five-flavor fruit.

## Healing Properties

### Anticonvulsive

(anti-convulsive, anticonvulsant, antiseizure, anti-seizure) used to prevent or reduce the severity of epileptic fits or seizures.

### Hepatoprotection

(antihepatotoxicity) prevents damage to the liver.
- Schisandra berry shows hepatoprotection against viral and various hepatotoxins.[^2]

### Hypnogenesis

Tranquilization, induces sleep or a hypnotic state.

### Muscle Health

- Prevents muscle atrophy[^1]
- Promotes muscle protein synthesis.[^1]
- Stimulates myogenesis (the formation of new muscle tissue).[^1]

### Neuroprotective

#### Brain health

- Improves cognitive function.
- Increases the level of Acetylcholine in the brain (Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter which is closely related to human learning and memory).
- Significantly protects against learning and memory impairments.[^2]

## Disease / Symptom Treatment

### Dementia

### Muscle Atrophy

### Muscle Weakness

### Neurodegenerative Diseases

#### Alzheimer's Disease

Alpinia oxyphylla & Schisandra chinensis herbs paired together were abled to ameliorate decreases in acetylcholine & M1 receptors in the hippocampus and cortex even better than Donepezil (a medication, marketed under the name Aricept, used in the palliative treatment of Alzheimer's disease).[^2]

### Liver Disease

Extract of Schisandra Berry has been officially applied in clinic for treatment of liver diseases.[^2]

Baill, Lycium chinense Mill and Eucommia ulmoides Oliv alleviates disuse muscle atrophy in rats<br>**Author(s):** Seongguk Cho, Riwon Hong, Poorm Yim, Mijung Yeom, Bombi Lee, Woong Mo Yang, Jongki Hong, Hyang Sook Lee, Dae–Hyun Hahm<br>**Institution(s):** Department of Science in Korean Medicine, Graduate School, Kyung Hee University, 02447 Seoul, Republic of Korea; Acupuncture and Meridian Science Research Center, College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, 02447 Seoul, Republic of Korea; Colleges of Pharmacy, Kyung Hee University, 02447 Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Kyung Hee University, 02447 Seoul, Republic of Korea<br>**Publication:** <i>Journal of Ethnopharmacology</i><br>**Abstract:** <i>**Ethnopharmacological relevance** Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill (SC), Lycium chinense Mill (LC) and Eucommia ulmoides Oliv (EU) are representative tonic herbal medicines that help to strengthen body muscles and bones making them stronger according to the Donguibogam, a tradition medical book of the Joseon Dynasty in Korea. **Aim of the study** To evaluate effects of an herbal formula consisting of SC, LC and EU on muscle atrophy in C2C12 myotubes and in a rat model of immobilization-induced muscle atrophy. **Materials and methods** Muscle atrophy was developed by cast immobilization of unilateral hindlimb on rats for 3 weeks. Treatments were administered orally 14 times over 3 weeks. After treatments, we compared the change of body weight, muscle weight, grip strength, muscle fiber size, muscle fiber type shift by Grip strength meter, H&E stain and ATPase stain. And western blot was used for evaluating molecular mechanism in muscle atrophy on C2C12 cells. **Results** When taken individually, SC was the most effective of the three in inhibiting tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)-induced degeneration of C2C12 myogenesis. The formulation with a mass ratio of 2:1:1 SC: LC: EU (SSLE) was more effective against TNF-α-induced muscle atrophy than was a 1:1:1 SC: LC: EU (SLE) formula or any of the single herbal extracts. In a rat model of disuse muscle atrophy, the SSLE formula significantly inhibited reductions in muscle weight, grip strength and muscle fiber size induced by hindlimb immobilization, in a dose-dependent manner. The formula also inhibited immobilization-induced shifting of the muscle fiber type in soleus muscle. Treatment with SSLE inhibited TNF-α-induced expression of the atrogenes atrogin-1 and muscle RING-finger protein 1 in C2C12 cells. The SSLE formula also increased myoblast differentiation markers (myoD and myogenin) and activation of the Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. **Conclusion** These findings suggest that the SSLE formula prevents muscle atrophy through inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome system as well as upregulation of myoblast differentiation and muscle protein synthesis in C2C12 cells. Taken together, we conclude that the SSLE formula is invaluable for the development of therapeutic medicines to prevent disuse muscle atrophy and its accompanying muscle weakness.</i><br>**Link:** [Source](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2017.10.008)<br>**Citations:**

In our previous study, we found both Alpinia oxyphylla and Schisandra chinensis can improve the cognitive function of AD. To investigate whether the Alpinia oxyphylla – Schisandra chinensis herb pair (ASHP) has ameliorating effect on cognitive impairment, we used scopolamine to induce learning and memory impairments, as a mouse model of AD. Subsequently, we carried out Y-maze test and Morris water maze test to observe the behavior of mice. Finally, the level of Acetylcholine (Ach) and muscarinic receptor (M1) receptors, the activity of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and acetyl cholinesterase (AChE) were measured by commercial assay kits and ELISA kit. And we used hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining to check the changes in cortex and the CA1 region of hippocampus. ASHP significantly protected against learning and memory impairments induced by scopolamine in Y-maze test and Morris water maze test. Besides, ASHP was able to increase the level of ACh and M1 receptors, and decrease the activity of AChE, but did not significantly affect the activity of ChAT. In addition, from the results of histopathological examination, we speculated ASHP may have neuroprotective effects. This study provided an experimental basis for further study of Alpinia oxyphylla − Schisandra chinensis herb pair in AD therapy.</i><br>**Link:** [Source](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2017.10.088)<br>**Citations:**
