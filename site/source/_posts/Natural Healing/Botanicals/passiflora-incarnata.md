## Healing Properties

- **Analgesic:**
- **Anticonvulsant:** hydroalcoholic extract of P. incarnata at a dose of 0.4 mg/kg not only prolonged the onset time of seizure but also decreased the duration of seizure as compared to the saline group.[^1]
    - hydro-ethanolic extract of P. incarnata suppressed seizures induced by the drug, pentylenetetrazole. The extract also ameliorated the postictal depression associated with the convulsant drug.[^1]
- **Anxiolytic:** The hydroalcoholic extract demonstrated antianxiety effects.[^1]
    - Methanol extracts of whole and sorted parts of P. incarnata also demonstrated anxiolytic effects [^1]
    - The P. incarnata extract administered in a dose of 375 mg/kg demonstrated an antianxiety effect comparable to diazepam.[^1]
- **Hypnotic:**
- **Sedative:** aqueous extract demonstrated sedative effects.[^1]
- **Vermicidal:**

## Disease / Symptom Treatment

- **Dysmenorrhoea:** has been used to treat painful menstruation, typically involving abdominal cramps.
- **Neurological Disorders:**
    - **Anxiety:** The benzoflavone moiety derived from the methanolic extract of P. incarnata dem- onstrated significant antianxiety activity.[^1]
        - Preoperative administration of P. incarnata by oral route showed suppressive effect on increasing anxiety without disturbing haemodynamics, sedation level and psychomotor functions.[^1]
        - P. incarnata extract has shown utility in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (anxiety neurosis).[^1]
    - **Epilepsy:**
    - **Hysteria:**
    - **Insomnia:**
    - **Mania:**
    - **Neurasthenia:**
- **Opioid/Opiates Withdrawl:** The methanolic extract of P. incarnata has been shown to delay the development of a tolerance to the analgesia of the opium alkaloid, morphine.[^1]
    - A single dose of methanolic extract of P. incarnata resulted in a decrease of naloxone-precipitated withdrawal symptoms in mice which have been made tolerant with chronic administration of morphine.[^1]
    - Passiflora included with clonidine treatment for opioid withdrawl showed distinctly superior improvements of mental symptoms.[^1]

This book is aimed at providing inside purview of the scope of natural products (including herbal and marine) in the possible treatment of neurological disorders. The book explains pre-clinical neuropharmacological investigations done on herbs including Bacopa monnieri, Hypericum perforatum, Passiflora incarnata, Scutellaria baicalensis and Piper methysticum. It provides a comprehensive overview of the role of phytoconstituents like huperzine, curcumin, Salvinorin A, bioflavonoids, sulforaphane, tanshinone IIA, tetramethylpyrazine, tetrahydrocannabinol, and cannabidiol in the treatment of neurological disorders. The book provides a modern concept of herbal medications, neuropharmacology of marine bioactive products and Ayurvedic formulations, herbal drugs with abuse potential and neurotoxic mycotoxins.</i><br>**Link:** [Source](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-13-0289-3)<br>**Citations:**
