**Ginseng** is a perennial plant that grows in the mountains of Eastern Asia.

## Composition

Most of the biological activities of ginseng are derived from its main constituents, ginsenosides.[^1]

Ginsenosides or panaxosides are a class of natural steroid glycosides and triterpene saponins.

- Compounds in this family are found almost exclusively in the plant genus Panax.

## Healing Properties

### Adaptogen

Panax ginseng exhibits adaptogenic properties related to the promotion of homeostasis and strengthening of systems impaired by stress.[^3]

#### Exercise

Ginseng can be used to improve physical performance.[^3]

Ginseng may be used to minimize the stress promoted by the practice of physical exercises.[^3]

##### Muscle Health

Ginseng produced a significant reduction in the levels of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) after physical stress.[^3]

- CPK and LDH are associated with muscle tissue breakdown.

### Anti-Cancer

Ginsenoside has been shown to exhibit anticancer activity in in vivo models.[^2]

#### Antimetastatic

### Cardiovascular Health (Heart Health)

## Disease / Symptom Treatment

### Heart Disease

#### Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion

Ginsenoside Rg3, a ginsenoside found in Panax ginseng, produced significant improvement in cardiac function and decreased the levels of LDH and CPK, as well as improvement in the size of the myocardial infarct.[^3]

### Cancer

#### Lung Cancer

Ginsenosides Rk1 and Rg5 are promising drugs for the treatmentNon-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC).[^2]
