**Cat's Claw**(Uncaria tomentosa) is a woody vine found in the tropical jungles of South and Central America. In several languages it is known as cat's claw because of its claw-shaped thorns. It is also known as vilcacora. The Polish journalist Roman Warszewski derives that name from the Quechua words "vilca" and "cora".
