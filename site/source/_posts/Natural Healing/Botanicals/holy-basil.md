#### Antiviral (anti-viral)

### Antioxidant

### Antispasmodic

### Brain Health

#### Attention

Tulsi treatment was shown to significantly improve willingness of adjustment and attention in humans.[^1]

#### Antilipemic (Lowers Cholesterol)

Promotes a healthy lipid profile.

### Digestive Aid

### Expectorant

### Immunomodulator

### Oral Health

Irrigation with Tulsi extract has beneficial effect on plaque control and gingival health and is at par with the gold standard of chlorhexidine.[^2]

### Relaxing (calms nerves)

## Disease & Symptom Treatment

### Allergic rhinitis

### Anxiety

Tulsi has good efficacy to negate anxiety related disorders in human subjects.[^1]

Tulsi may be a promising anxiolytic agent and a safer alternative to Benzodiazepines for the therapy of stress related clinical disorders.[^1]

- Tulsi significantly attenuated generalized anxiety disorders and also attenuated its correlated stress and depression.
  - It significantly improved attention and the willingness to adjustment.

### Colds and flu

### Depression

Depression index was also reduced after two-months of continuous treatment with Tulsi (O. sanctum).[^1]

Tulsi treatment significantly improved the willingness of adjustment and attention in human subjects.[^1]

### Diabetes

#### Insulin resistance

### Gingivitis

Irrigation with Tulsi extract has beneficial effect on plaque control and gingival health and is at par with the gold standard of chlorhexidine.[^2]

### Fungal Infections

### Head Trauma

Holy Basil may help speed up recovery from head trauma.

### Cardiovascular Disease

#### Atherosclerosis

#### High Blood Pressure

#### High Cholesterol (Hyperlipidemia, Hypercholesterolemia)

The content of polyphenol compounds such as flavonoids and tannins in basil leaves can reduce total cholesterol levels and inhibit fat oxidation which is the cause of atherosclerosis.[^3]

### Hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)

Tulsi treatment significantly improved the willingness of adjustment and attention in human subjects.[^1]

### Pain

### Stress

Tulsi (O. sanctum) has significant anti-stress and anxiolytic properties.[^1]

Tulsi extract showed overall improvement in stress management.[^1]

Two-months of regular administration with O. sanctum reduced stress, attenuated anxiety, negated depression and enhanced adjustment and attention in human subjects.[^1]

- These observations clearly indicate that O. sanctum has potential action in the regulation of hypothalamo-hypophyseal-adrenocortical axis (HHA axis) especially, during stress related disorders in human.[^1]

### Ulcers

### Viral Infections

#### Herpes virus
