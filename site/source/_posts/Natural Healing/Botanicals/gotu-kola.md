**Gotu Kola** (Centella asiatica) is a herbaceous, perennial flowering plant. It is used as a vegetable and as a medicinal herb.

Centella asiatica (family Apiaceae), commonly known as Indian Pennywort, is an ethnomedical plant that is widely used in India for treating skin problems and for revitalizing the brain and nervous system.[^1]

## Composition

Studies on the chemical constituents of C. asiatica showed the presence of pentacyclic triterpenoids known as centelloids.[^1]

These compounds are composed of terpene acids along with glycosides, including asiatic acid, asiaticoside, madecassic acid, madecassoside, brahmic acid, brahmoside, brahminoside, thankiniside, isothankunisode, madasiatic acid, centic acid,centelloside, and cenellic acid.[^1]

Asiatic acid and its derivatives possess a broad spectrum of pharmacological activities, such as anticancer, wound healing, antiinflammatory, antidiabetic, hepatoprotective, and neuroprotective activities. In addition, C. asiatica contains flavonoids, phenolic acids, and volatile oils,
which exhibit antioxidant activity.[^1]

Asiatic acid, asiaticoside, and madecassic acid have been reported as the major components of C. asiatica.[^1]

## Healing Properties

### Antidiabetic

### Antiinflammatory

### Antioxidant

### Anti-Cancer

Several studies have shown the anticancer effects of extracts and constituents from C. asiatica.[^1]

The major components of C. asiatica: Asiatic acid, asiaticoside, and madecassic acid have exhibited anticancer activity in various cancer cell lines.[^1]

- Asiatic acid has showed an antiproliferative effect by regulating apoptosis in a variety of human cancer cells, such as breast cancer, lung cancer, and melanoma cells.[^1]
- Madecassic acid has been found to inhibit cancer cell growth by inducing apoptosis in mouse colon cancer cells and exhibit antiproliferative  activities in various cancer cell lines via regulation of the ERK signaling pathway.[^1]
- Asiaticoside has anticancer effects which are mediated by the inhibition of cell migration and invasion via the STAT3 signaling pathway in multiple myeloma.[^1]

#### Radiotherapy enhancer

Inhibits the metastatic behaviors of cancer cells in radiotherapy.[^1]

Prevents Ionizing Radiation-induced migration and invasion of cancer cells.[^1]

### Brain Health

#### Memory Enhancer

#### Neuroprotective

### Hepatoprotective
