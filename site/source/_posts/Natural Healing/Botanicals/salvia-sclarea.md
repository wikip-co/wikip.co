**Salvia sclarea**

## Composition

- The major component of extracts from aerial parts of the Salvia species is Rosmarinic acid.
-  Total phenolic and flavonoid contents may include:
    - Rosmarinic acid
    - Caffeic acid
    - Quercetin

## Healing Properties

- **Antioxidant:** Salvia sclarea extract exhibits a strong free radical scavenging effect.[^1]

## Disease / Symptom Treatment

- **Leukemia:** Salvia sclarea extract showed remarkable cytotoxic effect toward human T-lymphoblast leukemia and adriamycin resistant leukemia.[^1]

The compositions of extracts were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a UV-DAD detector. The major component of extracts from aerial parts of Salvia species was rosmarinic acid (0.2 – 61.1%). The composition of methanol extract from aerial parts strongly differed from that of the root extract. The total phenolic and flavonoid contents per 100 g fresh weight ranged within 658.3 – 1805.9 mg of caffeic acid equivalent (CAE) and 13.0 – 184.9 mg of quercetin equivalent (QE), respectively. The highest DPPH• radical scavenging effect was observed for S. sclarea extract (with an IC50 of 21.6 μg/mL), while S. discolour extract exhibited the highest ABTS•+ radical scavenging ability (with IC50 of 53.0 μg/mL) among all extracts. All Salvia extracts showed remarkable cytotoxic effect toward human T-lymphoblast leukemia (CCRF-CEM) and adriamycin resistant leukemia (CEM/ADR 5000) with average IC50 values of 25.3 – 65 μg/mL and 34.5 – 89.8 μg/mL, respectively. A relatively strong effect against human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) was observed for the S. officinalis extract, with an IC50 of 138.5 μg/mL.</i><br>**Link:** [Source](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11094-018-1866-6)<br>**Citations:**
