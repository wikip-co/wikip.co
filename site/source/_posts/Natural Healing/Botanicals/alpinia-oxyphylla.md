**Alpinia oxyphylla** is a herbaceous plant that produces the "Yi Zhi Ren" fruit, also known as Black Cardamom or the 'seed of wisdom.'

## Healing Properties

### Antioxidant

### Anti-T2DM

(Prevents Type 2 diabetes mellitus)[^1]

### Gut Health

Modulates gut microbiota

### Brain Health

A. oxyphylla is effective for cognitive function improvement.[^2]

### Neuroregeneration (Nerve Regeneration)

A. oxyphylla is effective for the regrowth and repair of nerve tissues.[^2]

## Disease / Symptom Treatment

### Alzheimer's Disease

Alpinia oxyphylla paired with Schisandra chinensis demonstrated the ability to ameliorate abnormal changes in cognitive behavior induced by Amyloid beta plaque formation. Alpinia oxyphlla & Schisandra chinensis also inhibits the inflammatory signaling pathway in the brain to help cut down the damage of apoptosis. This herb pair might be a potential therapy for cognitive and behavioral deficits caused by Alzheimer's.[^2]

### Dementia

### Diabetes

- Decreases urine albumin excretion.
- Decreases resting blood sugar levels.
- Improves glucose intolerance.
- Decreases Glycated hemoglobin levels.
- Promotes more efficient glycemic control.

### Renal injury

Diabetic Induced Renal Injury can severely disrupt the architecture of the kidney, causing lesions and tubular atrophy.

- 500 mg/kg of Alpinia Oxyphylla attenuated renal damage and nearly fully recovered kidney structure.[^1]

### Diarrhea

### Inflammatory conditions

Extract Prevents Diabetes in Mice by Modulating Gut Microbiota<br>**Author(s):** Yiqiang Xie, Man Xiao, Yali Ni, Shangfei Jiang, Guizhu Feng, Shenggang Sang, and Guankui Du<br>**Institution(s):** First Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Haikou 571199, China; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Hainan Medical University, Haikou 571101, China<br>**Publication:** <i>Journal of Diabetes Research</i><br>**Date:** 4 June 2018<br>**Abstract:** <i>Recently, the role of gut microbiota in the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been highlighted. We performed an 8-week administration protocol on T2DM (C57BL/6J db-/db-) mice and fecal samples were collected. Comparisons of fecal bacterial communities were performed between db-/db- mice and normal mice (DB/DB) and between the db-/db mice treated and untreated with AOE using next-generation sequencing technology. Our results showed that the db-/db-AOE group had improved glycemic control and renal function compared with the db-/db-H2O group. Compared with the db-/db-H2O group, AOE administration resulted in significantly increased ratio of Bacteroidetes-to-Firmicutes in db-/db- mice. In addition, the abundance of Akkermansia was significantly increased, while Helicobacter was significantly suppressed in the db-/db-AOE group compared with the db-/db-H2O group. Our data suggest that AOE treatment decreased blood glucose levels and significantly reduced damage of renal pathology in the T2DM mice by modulating gut microbiota composition.</i><br>**Link:** [https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/4230590](https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/4230590)<br>**Citations:**
