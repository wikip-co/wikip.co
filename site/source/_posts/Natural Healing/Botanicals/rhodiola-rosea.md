**Rhodiola Rosea** (golden root, rose root, roseroot, Aaron's rod, Arctic root, king's crown, lignum rhodium, orpin rose) is a perennial flowering plant in the family Crassulaceae. It grows naturally in wild Arctic regions of Europe (including Britain), Asia, and North America, and can be propagated as a groundcover.

## Composition

Rhodioloside is one of the main active components of Rhodiola rosea.[^1]

Salidroside (SLDS) is a phenylpropanoid glycoside extracted from the root of Rhodiola rosea L and is one of the main active ingredients of this plant.[^2]

## Healing Properties

### Anti-Hypoxia

#### Exercise

Ginseng can be used to improve physical performance.[^3]

Ginseng may be used to minimize the stress promoted by the practice of physical exercises.[^3]

### Muscle Health

Ginseng produced a significant reduction in the levels of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) after physical stress.[^3]

- CPK and LDH are associated with muscle tissue breakdown.

### Brain Health

#### Neuroprotective

Rhodioloside extracted from Rhodiola exerts a protective effect on the neural system.[^1]

- Rhodioloside achieves its function of neuroprotection through several approaches.[^1]

Salidroside extracted from the root of Rhodiola significantly reduced cerebral infarction and improved neurological function after cerebral ischemia.[^2]

Salidroside treatment reduced the expression of M1 microglia/macrophage markers and increased the expression of M2 microglia/macrophage markers after stroke and induced primary microglia from M1 phenotype to M2 phenotype.[^2]

Salidroside treatment enhanced microglial phagocytosis and suppressed microglial-derived inflammatory cytokine release.[^2]

#### Myelination

Cocultures of oligodendrocytes and Salidroside-treated M1 microglia resulted in increased oligodendrocyte differentiation.[^2]

> **Oligodendrocytesa** are a type of large glial cell found in the central nervous system. **Involved in myelination:** Oligodendrocytes produce the myelin sheath insulating neuronal axons.

Moreover, SLDS protected neurons against oxygen glucose deprivation by promoting microglial M2 polarization.

##### Apoptotic regulation

Rhodioloside has anti-apoptotic effects which can provide a neuroprotective effect against total cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury.[^1]

> Method of action: Rhodioloside blocks neuronal apoptosis pathways and inhibits neuronal apoptosis through interfering with p53 and Bcl-2/Bax protein expression.[^1]

Rhodioloside was shown to reduce neurological deficit scores and increase neuronal survival rate of rats with total cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury.[^1]
