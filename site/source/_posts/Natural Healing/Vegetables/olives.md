**Olives** (Olea europaea) are the fruit of a species of small evergreen tree in the family Oleaceae, found traditionally in the Mediterranean region.

## Composition

-Vitamin E is the main vitamin present in table olives.

The health properties of Olea europaea L. are mostly attributable to a pool of secoiridoids such as oleuropein and its de-glycosylated derivatives (i.e. oleuropein aglycone and oleacein) as well as to simple phenols such as hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol.[^1]
