**Broccoli**

## Composition

- Broccoli sprout juice contains **sulforaphanyl-amine**.[^2]
- Broccoli sprouts are naturally enriched in glucoraphanin,the biological precursor to the anticancer compound sulforaphane.[^2]
- Vitamin C
- Flavonoids
- Glucosinolates

Broccoli as good sources of calcium.

## Healing Properties

### Anticancer (anticancer)

### Antiinflammatory

Broccoli is effective in preventing inflammatory responses.[^4]

### Prostate Health

### Weight Loss

### Hepatic Protection

(prevent damage to the liver) Dietary broccoli exerts a substantial protective effect on the liver.[^3]

- Broccoli consumption helps reduce plasma alanine aminotransferase concentrations in the liver. This is an enzyme found in the liver, normally at low levels. Increased levels of this enzyme are associated with liver damage and its level is used to screen for and/or monitor liver disease.[^3]

- Sulforaphane (an active compound in broccoli) protects against liver damage, indicating its potential to treat liver diseases.[^4]

Sulforaphane from broccoli reduces inflammation and liver cancer risk[^5]

Sulforaphane (SF), a broccoli-derived isothiocyanate, inhibits the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. SF was shown to suppress liver inflammation within 24hrs of treatment. SF was not associated with any cellular toxicity, indicating the protective effect of SF against inflammatory responses. This study revealed the potential usage of broccoli-derived SF as a functional food ingredient in attenuating liver inflammation and reducing liver cancer risk development.[^5]

# Disease / Symptom Treatment

### Cancer Treatment / Prevention

Medicinal vegetables such as broccoli and their derivative phyto-compounds are being increasingly recognized as useful complementary treatments for cancer.  Indole-3-carbinol (I3C), a natural phytochemical found in cruciferous vegetables (i.e. broccoli, cabbage or cauliflower), is considered a potential anticancer agent that prevents the development of certain types of tumors by activating tumor suppressor genes, genes involved in apoptosis and detoxification. I3C suppresses cell proliferation and induces apoptosis.[^1]

- Broccoli is effective in preventing carcinogenesis.[^4]

#### Ovarian cancer

#### Cervix carcinoma

#### Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)

(a form of liver cancer) Long-term consumption of whole broccoli countered development of hepatic tumorigenesis.[^3]

### Diabetes

Broccoli is effective in preventing diabetes.[^4]

### Obesity

### Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)

(hepatic lipidosis) Long-term consumption of whole broccoli countered NAFLD development enhanced by a Western diet.[^3]

- Dietary consumption of freeze-dried broccoli was shown to lower the level of hepatic triglycerides.[^3]
- Dietary broccoli decreased relative liver mass.[^3]
