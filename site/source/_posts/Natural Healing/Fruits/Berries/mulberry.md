## Description

**Mulberry** 

### Morus alba (White Mulberry)

Generally a short-lived tree with a lifespan comparable to that of humans, although there are some specimens known to be more than 250 years old.

The species is native to India, Central China and is widely cultivated and naturalized elsewhere (including United States, Mexico, Australia, Kyrgyzstan, Argentina, Turkey, Iran, India, and many others).

The white mulberry is widely cultivated to feed the silkworms employed in the commercial production of silk.

It is also notable for the rapid release of its pollen, which is launched at greater than half the speed of sound.

### Morus rubra (Red Mulberry)

Native to eastern and central North America.

Common in the United States, it is listed as an endangered species in Canada, and is susceptible to hybridization with the invasive white mulberry (M. alba), introduced from Asia.

### Morus nigra (Black Mulberry)

Native to southwestern Asia and the Iberian Peninsula.

The black mulberry is known for its large number of chromosomes.

## Uses

(mulberry leaf tea)

## Composition

Mulberry Extract contain high levels of the flavonoid, Rutin.[^1]

## Healing Properties

### Mitochondrial Function

Mulberry extracts contain large amounts of anthocyanin pigments such as Cy-3-glu and Cy-3-rut which increase mitochondrial function during in vitro brown adipogenesis.[^1]

### Weight Loss

Mulberry fruit supports weight loss.[^2]

Mulberry fruit has been reported to effectively reduce body weight by preventing visceral fat accumulation and limiting food intake.[^2]

Dried Mulberry fruit Powder supplementation has anti-obesity properties.[^2]

Dried Mulberry fruit powder can be used as a food supplement for weight control.[^2]

### Fatty Liver Disease

Mulberry fruit protects against fatty liver disease.[^2]

Dried Mulberry fruit Powder supplementation improves liver lipid profile.[^2]

Dried Mulberry fruit powder can be used as a food supplement for prevention against liver lipid accumulation (fatty liver disease) resulting from a high fat diet.[^2]
