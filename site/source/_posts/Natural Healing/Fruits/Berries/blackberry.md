The **Blackberry** is an edible soft fruit, consisting of a cluster of soft purple-black drupelets.

## Healing Properties

### Brain Health

#### Antioxidant

Free radical scavenging.[^1]

#### Anti-Glycation

Glycation is associated with several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), where it potentiates the aggregation and toxicity of proteins such as β-amyloid (Aβ).[^1]

Glycation is a process that interferes with the molecular and cellular functioning of the entire body.   It involves the release of highly oxidizing side-products such as hydrogen peroxide. Damage by glycation results in stiffening of the collagen in the blood vessel walls, leading to high blood pressure, especially in diabetes.[^1]

Glycations also cause weakening of the collagen in the blood vessel walls, which may lead to micro- or macro-aneurisms; this may cause strokes if in the brain.[^1]

Parts of the body most at risk to the affects of glycation are: Long-lived cells (such as nerves and different types of brain cell), long-lasting proteins (Cells such as the retina cells in the eyes; crystallins of the lens and cornea), and DNA may accumulate substantial damage over time.[^1]

Red blood cells have a consistent lifespan of 120 days and are easily accessible for measurement of glycation.[^1]

#### Microglial Neuroprotective

Polyphenol & anthocyanin-enriched extracts of blackberry help protect the brain's microglia (Microglia are a type of glial cell located throughout the brain and spinal cord. Microglia account for 10–15% of all cells found within the brain. Microglia act as the first and main form of active immune defense in the central nervous system).[^1]

- Decreased cytotoxicity in microglia[^1]
- Prevents Ameloydβeta fibrillation[^1]
