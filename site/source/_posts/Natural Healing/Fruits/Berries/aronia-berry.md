The **Aronia Berry** (also known as the Chokeberry) is known for its dense content of polyphenols, especially anthocyanins. The total polyphenol and proanthocyanidin content are among the highest measured in plants to date.

Aronia Berries contain a high concentration of phenolic compounds (anthocyanins, procyanidins, hydroxycinnamic acids and flavonols).

The Aronia Berry has three varieties.  **Red chokeberry**, Aronia arbutifolia (Photinia pyrifolia); **Black chokeberry**, Aronia melanocarpa (Photinia melanocarpa); and **Purple chokeberry**, Aronia prunifolia (Photinia floribunda).

## Composition

Polyphenols

## Healing Properties

### Antiaging

The strongest antiaging properties of any berry.

### Anticancer

### Anti-Diabetic activity

Oral administration of aronia 100 mg/kg has the effect of decreasing the increase of blood glucose level and also has the protection effect of pancreas β cells.[^2]

### Antiinflammatory

Aronia berry extract significantly suppresses inflammatory cytokines.[^1]

### Antioxidant

### Cardioprotective

### Endothelial Health

Powerful inhibititor of vascular endothelial inflammation.[^1]

### Weight Loss

AJC supplementation has the potential to prevent weight gain and markers of obesity.[^4]

### Energy (Metabolism)

Aronia Berry Juice Concentrate supplementation had a significant effect on diet efficiency causing subjects to need less energy intake to maintain body processes (i.e. growth) and become more efficient at using the energy they consume.[^4]

### Glucose Regulation

Aronia Berry Juice Concentrate supplementation has been shown to increase adiponectin levels.

- Adiponectin (also referred to as GBP-28, apM1, AdipoQ and Acrp30) is a protein hormone which is involved in regulating glucose levels as well as fatty acid breakdown. In humans it is encoded by the ADIPOQ gene and it is produced in adipose tissue.

## Disease / Symptom Treatment

### Cancer

### Type I Diabetes

Type 1 diabetes (T1D), an insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, is caused by damage and destruction of pancreatic β cells that produce insulin. It is a disease that is characterized by hyperglycemia and hypoinsulinemia.[^2]

#### Insulin Resistance

Aronia Berry decreased risk factors associated with insulin resistance in rats fed a fructose-rich diet through modulation of multiple pathways associated with insulin signaling, adipogenesis and inflammation.[^4]

### Inflammation

#### Inflammatory Bowel Disease

Aronia melanocarpa (Black Aronia Berry) fruit juice ameliorates the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.[^3]

#### Colitis

The effects of taking Aronia Berry Juice were comparable or even higher than that of the **Antiinflammatory** drug sulfasalazine (works better than pharmaceutical drug).[^3]

### Obesity

Aronia Berry Juice Concentrate supplementation had a significant effect on preventing weight gain.
