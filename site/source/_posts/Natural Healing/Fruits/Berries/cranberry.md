## Healing Properties

### Brain Health

### Antioxidant

Free radical scavenging.

### Anti-Glycation

Glycation is associated with several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD, where it potentiates the aggregation and toxicity of proteins such as β-amyloid (Aβ).[^1]

> Glycation is a process that interferes with the molecular and cellular functioning of the entire body.   It involves the release of highly oxidizing side-products such as hydrogen peroxide.

- Damage by glycation results in stiffening of the collagen in the blood vessel walls, leading to high blood pressure, especially in diabetes.
- Glycations also cause weakening of the collagen in the blood vessel walls, which may lead to micro- or macro-aneurisms; this may cause strokes if in the brain.
- Parts of the body most at risk to the affects of glycation are: Long-lived cells (such as nerves and different types of brain cell), long-lasting proteins (Cells such as the retina cells in the eyes; crystallins of the lens and cornea), and DNA may accumulate substantial damage over time. 
- Red blood cells have a consistent lifespan of 120 days and are easily accessible for measurement of glycation. 

### Microglial Neuroprotective

Polyphenol & anthocyanin-enriched extracts of blackberry help protect the brain's microglia.[^1]

> Microglia are a type of glial cell located throughout the brain and spinal cord. Microglia account for 10–15% of all cells found within the brain. Microglia act as the first and main form of active immune defense in the central nervous system.

- Decreased cytotoxicity in microglia.[^1]
- Prevents Ameloydβeta fibrillation[^1]
