## Healing Properties

### Antioxidant

Free radical scavenging.

### Brain Health

#### Neuroprotective

##### Anti-Glycation

Glycation is associated with several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD, where it potentiates the aggregation and toxicity of proteins such as β-amyloid (Aβ).

- **Glycation** is a process that interferes with the molecular and cellular functioning of the entire body.   It involves the release of highly oxidizing side-products such as hydrogen peroxide.
- Damage by glycation results in stiffening of the collagen in the blood vessel walls, leading to high blood pressure, especially in diabetes.
- Glycations also cause weakening of the collagen in the blood vessel walls, which may lead to micro- or macro-aneurisms; this may cause strokes if in the brain.
- Parts of the body most at risk to the affects of glycation are: Long-lived cells (such as nerves and different types of brain cell), long-lasting proteins (Cells such as the retina cells in the eyes; crystallins of the lens and cornea), and DNA may accumulate substantial damage over time. 
- Red blood cells have a consistent lifespan of 120 days and are easily accessible for measurement of glycation. 

##### Microglial Protection

Polyphenol & anthocyanin-enriched extracts of blackberry help protect the brain's microglia. **Microglia** are a type of glial cell located throughout the brain and spinal cord. Microglia account for 10–15% of all cells found within the brain. Microglia act as the first and main form of active immune defense in the central nervous system.

- Decreased cytotoxicity in microglia.
- Prevents Ameloydβeta fibrillation

## Disease / Symptom Treatment

### Neurodegenerative Diseases

#### Alzheimer's

Published studies support the anti-glycation and neuroprotective effects of several polyphenol-rich fruits, including berries, which are rich in anthocyanins. Herein, blackberry, black raspberry, blueberry, cranberry, red raspberry, and strawberry extracts were evaluated for: (1) total phenolic and anthocyanins contents, (2) free radical (DPPH) scavenging and reactive carbonyl species (methylglyoxal; MGO) trapping, (3) anti-glycation (using BSA-fructose and BSA-MGO models), (4) anti-Aβ aggregation (using thermal- and MGO-induced fibrillation models), and, (5) murine microglia (BV-2) neuroprotective properties. Berry crude extracts (CE) were fractionated to yield anthocyanins-free (ACF) and anthocyanins-enriched (ACE) extracts. The berry ACEs (at 100 μg/mL) showed superior free radical scavenging, reactive carbonyl species trapping, and anti-glycation effects compared to their respective ACFs. The berry ACEs (at 100 μg/mL) inhibited both thermal- and MGO-induced Aβ fibrillation. In addition, the berry ACEs (at 20 μg/mL) reduced H2O2-induced reactive oxygen species production, and lipopolysaccharide-induced nitric oxide species in BV-2 microglia as well as decreased H2O2-induced cytotoxicity and caspase-3/7 activity in BV-2 microglia. The free radical scavenging, reactive carbonyl trapping, anti-glycation, anti-Aβ fibrillation, and microglial neuroprotective effects of these berry extracts warrant further in vivo studies to evaluate their potential neuroprotective effects against AD.</i><br>**Link:** [http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms19020461](http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms19020461)<br>**Citations:**
