**Jambolan** (Syzygium cumini) is also known as the Java plum, black plum, Portuguese plum, Malabar plum, or Philippine Duhat.  Jambolan fruit contains a high amount of vitamin A and vitamin C.<!--more-->

## Healing Properties

- **Anti-Hyperglycemic:** extract of S. cumini leaves exhibits blood sugar reducing effects.[^1]
- **Astringent:**

## Disease / Symptom Treatment

- **Diabetes:** Medicinal plants such as Jambolan fruit may provide natural diabetic control by helping mimic normal basal blood glucose levels in body.[^1]
  - **Hyperglycemia:** is an excess of glucose in the bloodstream (often associated with diabetes) and directly contributes to various microvascular complications like **retinopathy** (disease of the retina that results in impairment or loss of vision) and **nephropathy** (disease or damage of the kidney). 
    - Jambolan leave extract (S. cumini) may help lower mean blood glucose levels.[^1]

[^1]: **Title:** Evaluation of the Anti-Hyperglycemic Property of the Philippine Duhat (Syzygium cumini), Crude Methanolic Leaf Extract on Glucose Challenged Hyperglycemic Mice<br>**Author(s):** Allan L Hilario<br>**Institution(s):** Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Medicine, University of the Philippines-Manila, 547 Pedro Gil St., Ermita, Manila 1000 Philippines<br>**Publication:** <i>Der Pharma Chemica,</i><br>**Date:** 2018<br>**Abstract:** <i>Due to metabolic stress secondary to hyperglycemia and safety issues of primary pharmacologic agents used for the treatment of diabetes, safer plant-based natural products are being evaluated as alternative supplements in ensuring normal basal glucose level both in normal and diabetic patients. Recent studies have focused on developing such herbal drugs from plants like Syzygium cumini. This plant is readily used as an herbal drug in the Philippines due to its known medicinal properties;there are no sufficient studies currently available in the literature that validates the  efficacy  of  the  local  duhat  variety  against  hyperglycemia  especially  that  of  the  leaf  extract.  In  this  study,  crude  methanolic  extract  of S. cumini leaves was evaluated for its anti-hyperglycemic property. Upon administration of treatment in glucose challenged hyperglycemic mice at 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 h, results showed that the mean blood glucose levels of hyperglycemic mice treated with glibenclamide had a constant significant decrease as compared with the normal control (p=0.00045; p<0.05). Similar findings were noted with the mean blood glucose levels of  hyperglycemic  mice  treated  with  S.  cumini  crude  methanolic  extract  (p=0.00575;  p<0.05).  Hyperglycemia  was  controlled  earlyon  the observation  period  after  glibenclamide  administration  and  later  after  S.  cumini  crude  methanolic  leaf  extract  administration.  It  can  be established  that  the  crude  methanolic  extract  of  S.  cumini  leaves  exhibits  anti-hyperglycemic  property  on  glucose  challenged  hyperglycemic mice. This plant can be a potential source of herbal drugs to supplement the pharmacologic treatment of diabetes.</i><br>**Link:** [https://www.derpharmachemica.com/pharma-chemica/evaluation-of-the-antihyperglycemic-property-of-the-philippine-duhat-syzygium-cumini-crude-methanolic-leaf-extract-on-gl.pdf](https://www.derpharmachemica.com/pharma-chemica/evaluation-of-the-antihyperglycemic-property-of-the-philippine-duhat-syzygium-cumini-crude-methanolic-leaf-extract-on-gl.pdf)<br>**Citations:**
