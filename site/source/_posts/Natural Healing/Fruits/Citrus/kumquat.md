**Kumquats** (Citrus japonica; formerly classified in the Fortunella genus) are an edible citrus fruit that resemble miniature oranges. They are round or oval shaped and can be eaten whole. The peel has a sweet flavor, but the fruit has a sour center.  They possess high nutritional content and are commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine.

## Composition

- Kumquat peel was found to contain sigificant quantities of Potassium, Magnesium, Calcium and Sodium.[^2]
- The major phenolic acids found were p-hydroxybenzoic acid that followed by vanillic, protocatechuic, chlorogenic and sinapic acids, respectively.[^2]
- The extract contained apigenin 7-glucosideflavonoid.
- Volatiles oil analysis showed that kumquat peel essential oil was rich in monoterpenoid limonene (96.33%).
  - The oil was also composed of considerable amount of d-germacrene, α-myrecene, and α-pinene and minor amount of bicyclogermacrene and sabinene.[^2]
- Carotenoids
  - Eleven native carotenoids were successfully identified in kumquats:
    - β-carotene
    - β-cryptoxanthin
    - Lutein
    - Zeaxanthin
    - β-citraurin-caproate
    - β-citraurin-laurate
    - β-citraurin-myristate
    - β-citraurin-palmitate
    - β-cryptoxanthin-laurate
    - β-cryptoxanthin-myristate
    - β-cryptoxanthin-palmitate
  - β-citraurin-laurate and β-cryptoxanthin-laurate were the most abundant native carotenoids.[^3]
  - The total carotenoid content of kumquats was high (2185.16 µg/100 g), suggesting that this fruit can contribute significantly to the ingestion of important bioactive compounds.[^3]

Abdelgayed<br>**Institution(s):** Nutrition and Food Sciences Department, National Research Centre, Dokki, Cairo, Egypt; Pathology Department, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt<br>**Publication:** <i>Journal of Herbmed Pharmacology</i><br>**Date:** July 2019<br>**Abstract:** <i>Introduction: Protection of brain against accelerated aging helps avoiding the occurrence of neurodegenerative diseases. So, the current work was conducted to evaluate the rescuing role of kumquat fruits crude ethanol extract, carrot seeds ethanol and petroleum ether extracts against the brain aging induced by D-galactose in rats. Methods: Forty male Sprague Dawley rats were divided equally into five groups. Group I was served as normal control, rats of group II were daily injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 150 mg/kg BW of D-galactose. Rats of group III, IV and V were daily injected i.p. with the same dose of D-galactose and administered orally with 250 mg/kg BW/day of kumquat fruits crude ethanol extract, carrot seeds ethanol extract and carrot seeds petroleum ether extract, respectively. After 6 weeks the rats were scarified, brain tissues were analyzed for malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT) as well as histological examination. Also, the plasma was analyzed for MDA, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), creatinine and urea levels, as well as CAT, butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) activities.
Results: From the results, it was elucidated that the tested extracts suppressed both the reduction in CAT and the elevation in MDA either in brain or plasma and the increase in plasma TNF-α, BChE as well as liver and kidney parameters.
Conclusion: The tested extracts can be served as potent protective agents against the accelerated aging parameters which may be due to anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities.</i><br>**Link:** [Source](http://www.herbmedpharmacol.com/Files/Inpress/jhp-16385.pdf)<br>**Citations:**

The mineral composition (ICP-MS), phenolic and flavonoid contents (HPLC), volatiles (GC–MS), antioxidant activity (DPPH) and antimicrobial activity of kumquat peel were determined. Kumquat peel was found to be a good supplement of K, Mg, Ca and Na. The major phenolic acids found were p-hydroxybenzoic acid that followed by vanillic, protocatechuic, chlorogenic and sinapic acids, respectively. The extract contained also apigenin 7-glucosideflavonoid. The volatiles oil analysis showed that kumquat peel essential oil was rich in monoterpenoid limonene (96.33%). The oil was also composed of considerable amount of d-germacrene, α-myrecene, and α-pinene and minor amount of bicyclogermacrene and sabinene. The highest antioxidant activity was obtained using 70% ethanol extract (55.47%), while the least one was observed with n-hexane (27.05%). The antioxidant activity of kumquat extract increased from (21.31%) when the extract concentration was (63 µg/100 µl) to (64.98%) with concentration of (1000 µg/100 µl). Regarding the antimicrobial activity, the highest zone of inhibition (16.58 mm) was recorded with 70% ethanol extract, while the least zone of inhibition (8.98 mm) was found with acetone extract. Staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive organism with the highest zone of inhibition (16.70 mm) and Escherichia coli was the most resistant organism with the least zone of inhibition (11.30 mm). The present study reviewed antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of different extracts of kumquat peel and concluded that kumquat peel might be used as a natural bioactive source, mainly in the food and pharmaceutical industries.</i><br>**Link:** [Source](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11694-019-00244-y)<br>**Citations:**

Eleven carotenoids were successfully identified and quantified in kumquat: four carotenoids in the free form and seven carotenoids in the esterified form. β-citraurin-laurate was the carotenoid found in the highest content (607.33 µg/100 g fresh matter), followed by β-cryptoxanthin-laurate (552.59 µg/100 g). The different esterified forms of β-citraurin and β-cryptoxanthin represented 84.34% of the carotenoids found, which demonstrates the importance of esterification in natural fruits. β-carotene and free xanthophylls (β-cryptoxanthin, lutein and zeaxanthin) represented 5.50% and 14.96%, respectively, of total carotenoids in kumquat. The total carotenoid content of kumquat from Brazil was very high (2185.16 µg/100 g), suggesting that this fruit could contribute significantly to the intake of important bioactive compounds by the population.</i><br>**Link:** [Source](https://doi.org/10.3390/foods8050166)<br>**Citations:**
