**Apricot** is a fruit of several species in the genus Prunus (stone fruits).

## Species & Cultivars

### Prunus armeniaca

Prunus armeniaca means Armenian plum. Also called ansu apricot, Siberian apricot, and Tibetan apricot.

Prunus armeniaca is one of the most important Mediterranean fruits.[^2]

It is also the most commonly cultivated apricot species.

Prunus Armeniaca 'Goldrich' is a cultivar with high polyphenol content.[^2]

### Prunus mandshurica

Also called **Manchurian apricot** and **scout apricot**.

A variety of the Siberian apricot (Tibetan apricot) Prunus armeniaca.

Native to northeast China, Korea, and Manchuria.

The Manchurian apricot has high levels of the polyphenol Phloretin.[^1]

### Prunus brigantina

### Prunus mume

### Prunus zhengheensis

### Prunus sibirica

## Composition

The concentration of polyphenols in apricot peel is 10 fold higher than flesh.[^2]

## Healing Properties

### Antiinflammatory

### Antioxidant

### Antitumor (anticancer)

### Heart Health

#### Antihypertensive

##### Vasorelaxation

Phloretin, a polyphenol found in apricots, has the effect of regulating vascular tone. It has been specifically shown to inhibit arterial vasocontriction.[^1] This means that it can promote a reduction in tension of the blood vessel walls.[^1]

Phloretin is an auxiliary mechanism for relaxing the arteries, besides typical stimulation of the endothelium.[^1]

Phloretin actually inhibits the contractions of arteries by acting directly on the smooth muscle (not just the endothelium), therefore this can have a beneficical therapeutic effect on individuals with diseased enothelium (such as with atherosclerosis or diabetes).[^1]
