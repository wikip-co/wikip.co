**Bananas** are the leading fruit produced and consumed globally, and are an important source of carbohydrate energy, potassium, vitamin B6, vitamin C, and other micronutrients.[^2]

## Healing Properties

- **Antiinflammatory:** Ingesting Bananas and Water before an exercise bout, helps attenuate the post-exercise increase in oxidized linoleic acid metabolites.[^1]
  - *Inflammatory processes are elevated during recovery from intensive and long-duration exercise.*[^1]
  - Carbohydrate intake, such as that from bananas, help provide enhanced glucose availability to the working muscles, resulting in reduced post-exercise cortisol and epinephrine levels, decreased leukocytosis and phagocytosis, and lower inflammatory cytokines.[^1]
  - Reduces reliance on glycolysis for ATP production.[^1]

## Disease / Symptom Treatment

- **Diabetes:** Reduces reliance on glycolysis for ATP production.[^1]
