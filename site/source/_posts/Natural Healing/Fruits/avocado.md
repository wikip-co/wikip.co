**Avocado** (Persea Americana Mill.) is a native fruit of Central and South America.[^1]

## Composition

Avocados are rich in fat (approximately 15% by wt.).[^1]

Avocados contain predominantly monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA; 9.6% by wt.), which represent 62.8% to 63.6% of the total fatty acids found in avocados, with a predominance of oleic acid.[^1]

The oil consists of approximately 71% MUFAs, 13% polyunsaturated fatty acids, 16% saturated fatty acids, fiber, vitamin B, vitamin K1, vitamin E, magnesium, potassium, and phytochemicals such as carotenoids, phenolics, and phytosterols.[^1]

## Healing Properties

### Antiinflammatory

Chronic avocado oil ingestion reduces C-reactive protein.[^2]

### Antioxidant

Avocado oil has a wide variety of lipophilic antioxidants, which may decrease ROS production in renal mitochondria.[^1]

### Blood Health

Chronic avocado pulp treatment improves anti-platelet and anti-thrombotic activities.[^2]

There are acute benefcial properties of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acid from avocado on glycemic and vascular markers during an acute postprandial challenge in middle-aged, overweight or obese subjects.[^2]

#### Cholesterol Levels

The high concentrations of MUFAs in avocado suggest that an avocado-rich diet results in beneficial effects on blood lipids.[^1]

Chronic avocado oil ingestion reduced triglycerides and LDL and VLDL cholesterol.[^2]

The inclusion of one fresh avocado per day in a moderately fatty diet supports an improvement in cholesterol levels.[^2]

#### High Cholesterol (hypercholesterolemia)

8 weeks supplementation with avocado oil (450 and 900 mg/kg/day) partially improved the lipid profile (lower LDL and triglycerides and higher HDL) and increased the activity of the Krebs cycle.[^1]

### Antiobesity

Supplementation with hydroalcoholic extracts of the fruit (100-mg/kg body weight) for 12 weeks reduced weight gain (24.77%) and BMI (17.92%).[^1]

### Insulen sensitivity

Body weight reduction and improved insulin sensitivity were observed in rats fed a sucrose-rich diet and supplemented with 10–30% avocado oil for
8 weeks.[^1]

### Heart Health

Chronic ingestion of aqueous avocado leaf extract is benefcial in improving cardiovascular parameters.[^2]

#### Blood Pressure

Chronic avocado oil consumption has beneficial effects on cardiovascular physiology, including lowered systemic blood pressure, reduced renal reactive oxygen species, improved renal endothelium-dependent vasodilation and kidney mitochondrial function, suggesting that avocado positively interacts with the angiotensin system in regulating blood pressure.[^2]

#### Heart Disease

##### Atherosclerosis

Decreases the risk of atherogenic plaque formation.[^1]

#### Exercise

Avocado pulp prior to aerobic exercise improves a number of cardiovascular and autonomic variables during recovery in healthy females.[^2] This outcome supports the advantageous efects of avocado pulp prior to exertion, suggesting the benefcial use of avocado before exercise.[^2]

### Liver Health

Treatment with an aqueous extract of avocado (100 and 200 mg/kg) protects against hepatic toxicity.[^1]

- It reduces the activity of the liver enzymes aspartate aminotransferase and serum alanine aminotransferase and decreased serum bilirubin levels.[^1]

### Kidney Health

Chronic avocado oil consumption reduced renal reactive oxygen species, improved renal endothelium-dependent vasodilation and kidney mitochondrial function, suggesting that avocado positively interacts with the angiotensin system.[^2]

## Disease / Symptom Treatment

### Diabetes

Helps control glycemia.[^1]
