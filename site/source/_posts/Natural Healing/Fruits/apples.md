Apples (Malus domestica) are one of the most significant fruits in all of the world.[^1]

## Healing Properties

### Antioxidant

Many types of antioxidant compounds are present in apple fruit and apple peels.[^1]

Apples contain a large number, and high levels, of phenolic compounds with antioxidant activity.[^1]

Polyphenols are the chief antioxidant biomolecules contained in apples. There is a correlation between the content of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity among all the varieties of apple.[^1]

### Antimicrobial

#### Antiviral

##### Anti-Influenza (flu virus)

### Hepatoprotective (antihepatotoxicity)

Helps prevent damage to the liver.

Apple polyphenols have the potential to be hepatoprotective and inhibit hepatic steatosis.[^1]

### Reducing cholesterol

## Disease / Symptom Treatment

### Heart Disease

A reduced risk of cardiovascular disease has been associated with apple consumption especially in women.[^2]

#### Coronary artery disease 

##### Atherosclerosis

Phytosterols in apples have been shown to help prevent coronary atherosclerosis and treat heart disease.[^1]

### Lung Disease

Apple consumption has been positively associated with general pulmonary health.[^2]

#### Asthma

Apple consumption has been inversely linked with asthma.[^2]

Apple and pear intake has been associated with a decreased risk of asthma and a decrease in bronchial hypersensitivity.[^2]

#### Pleuritis (Pleurisy)

Apples have been shown to be effective in pleurisy (inflammation of the tissues that line the lungs and chest cavity).[^2]

#### Dyspnea

Apples have been shown to be effective in treating and preventing dyspnea and shortness of breath.[^2]

### Cough suppressant (anti-cough)

Apple consumption has been shown to be effective in treating and preventing coughing.[^2]

### Acute respiratory infection

Apples are a medicinal food with therapeutic effect in treating infections of the respiratory tract.[^2]

#### Covid-19 (Novel Coronavirus)
Apples have been considered as part of a therapeutic diet appropriate to help treat respiratory infections similar to COVID-19.[^2]

## Composition

A large number of bioactive substances including polyphenols, polysaccharides, plant sterols, pentacyclic triterpenes, and organic acids have been found in apples.[^1]

Apples contains zinc.[^1]

Apples contain phytosterols such as sitosterol and daucosterol.[^1]
