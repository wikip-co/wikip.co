## Composition

## Healing Properties

### Antioxidant

### Anti-Inflammatory

### Brain Health

- Urolithins are a specific constituent of pomegranate extrac that meet the necessary criteria for Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) penetration.[^1]
- In vitro studies showed that urolithins were able to prevent the fibrillation of Aβ, while methyl-urolithin B had a protective effect against Aβ-induced neurotoxicity and paralysis.[^1]
- Urolithins A and B can lower levels of nitric oxide and reduce the expression of proinflammatory genes (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, inducible nitric oxide synthase [iNOS], and cyclooxygenase-2 [COX-2]) in microglia treated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS).[^1]
- Urolithins A and B can inhibit the activation of signaling pathways (ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, Akt, nuclear factor kappa B [NF-κB]) involved in inflammation.[^1]

### Endothelial Health

Helps repair the inner lining of blood vessels.

## Disease / Symptom Treatment

### Alzheimer's Disease

- Urolithin compounds in pomegranate are able to cross the BBB and contribute to its anti-Alzheimer’s disease effects.[^1]
