Frenkel, Avivit Peer, Eli Rosenbaum, David Margel, David Leonid Sarid, Victoria Neiman, Maya Gottfried, Natalie Maimon, Ilan Leibovitch, Hadas Dresler, Isaac Eliaz<br>**Institution(s):** Meir Medical Center, Kfar-Saba, Israel; Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel; Davidoff Cancer Center, Petah Tikva, Israel; Ichilov Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel; Lung Cancer Unit, Meir Medical Center, Kfar-Saba, Israel; Amitabha Medical Clinic and Healing Center, Santa Rosa, CA; <br>**Publication:** <i>Journal of Clinical Oncology</i><br>**Date:** February 20 2018<br>**Abstract:** <i>Background: 30% of pts with localized PC will have a biochemical relapse post local tx. The optimal tx of these pts remains elusive. While androgen deprivation therapy is effective in reducing PSA level, its long-term benefit on survival remain undefined, and it is associated with significant cumulative toxicities.Thus, evaluation of new non-toxic compounds in this pt population is warranted. P-MCP is a competitive inhibitor of galectin-3, a carbohydrate-binding protein, which is known to be involved in cancer pathogenesis. Pre-clinical and clinical data suggest that P-MCP is active in PC. We aimed to evaluate the safety and PSA dynamics of tx with P-MCP in pts with BRPC. Methods: Pts with non-castrate non-metastatic BRPC were enrolled in a prospective phase 2 study of tx with oral P-MCP, at 4.8 grams X 3/day for 6 months (mos). Pts that did not progress clinically, biochemically (PSA), and radiologically, at 6 mos, were treated for subsequent 12 mos. Sample size provided 85% power to assess a decrease in PSA progression rate from 80% (natural history) to 40% (P-MCP tx) at 6 mos. Results: The study was initiated in June 2013. 35 pts were enrolled. Median age was 74 years. Treatment of the primary tumor consisted of surgery in 11% (n = 4), radiation in 69% (n = 24), and both in 20% (n = 7). No pt had tx related grade 3/4 toxicity. One patient withdrew his consent after 1 mos. Of the 34 pts analyzed, 18% (n = 6) had grade 1 toxicity. 62% (n = 21) had a stabilization/decrease of PSA, and negative scans, at 6 mos, and entered the second 12 mos tx phase. A stabilization or improvement (increase) of PSA doubling time was noted in 79% (n = 27) of pts. Disease progression at 6 mos was noted in 38% (n = 13: PSA only 29%, n = 10; PSA and scans 9%, n = 3). Conclusions: The present study suggests a potential benefit of P-MCP tx on progression of BRPC. P-MCP tx is safe.</i><br>**Link:** [http://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2018.36.6_suppl.14](http://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2018.36.6_suppl.14)<br>**Citations:**

</i><br>**Date:** May 16 2018<br>**Abstract:** <i>Modified citrus pectin (MCP) is a carbohydrate enriched complex, which has been implicated in cancer treatment and prevention. However, the effects of MCP on urinary bladder cancer (UBC) are unknown. In this study, MCP was first tested in T24 and J82 human UBC cells and showed the inhibition of cell viability by the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay. The MCP-treated UBC cells exhibited G2/M phase arrest with the decrease of Cyclin B1 and phosphorylated Cdc2. Caspase-3 was also activated, leading to the cleavage of Caspase-3 and PARP. We further explored the possible molecular mechanisms upon MCP treatment in UBC cells. Reduction of galectin-3 was observed and followed with the inactivation of Akt signaling pathway. Of note, galectin-3 knockdown by RNA interference recapitulated the MCP-mediated anti-proliferation, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Moreover, oral administration of MCP to the T24 xenograft-bearing nude mice inhibited the tumor growth significantly (P < 0.05). Quantification analysis of immunohistochemistry staining for Ki67 and cleaved Caspase-3 confirmed the decrease of proliferation index (P < 0.05) and the increase of apoptosis index (P < 0.01) in 700 mg/kg MCP-fed UBC xenografts. Using the information from TCGA database, we revealed that the overexpression of galectin-3 was associated with high tumor grade with lymph node metastasis, poor overall survival in UBC patients. Considering the remarkable inhibitory effects of MCP on UBC cell proliferation and survival in vitro and in vivo mainly through galectin-3, which is upregulated in UBCs, MCP may become an attractive agent, as a natural dietary fiber, for prevention and therapy of UBCs.</i><br>**Link:** [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41401-018-0004-z](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41401-018-0004-z)<br>**Citations:**

In the last decade, considerable interest in galectin-3 has emerged because of its potential role as a biotarget. Galectin-3 is differentially expressed depending on the tissue type, however its expression can be induced under conditions of tissue injury or stress. Galectin-3 overexpression and secretion is associated with several diseases and is extensively studied in the context of fibrosis, heart failure, atherosclerosis and diabetes mellitus. Monomeric (extracellular) galectin-3 usually undergoes further “activation” which significantly broadens the spectrum of biological activity mainly by modifying its carbohydrate-binding properties. Self-interactions of this protein appear to play a crucial role in regulating the extracellular activities of this protein, however there is limited and controversial data on the mechanisms involved. We therefore summarize (recent) literature in this area and describe galectin-3 from a binding perspective providing novel insights into mechanisms by which galectin-3 is known to be “activated” and how such activation may be regulated in pathophysiological scenarios.</i><br>**Link:** [https://dx.doi.org/10.7150%2Fthno.22196](https://dx.doi.org/10.7150%2Fthno.22196)<br>**Citations:**
