**Pectin** is plant based, and consists of a complex set of polysaccharides.  The amount, structure and chemical composition of pectin differs among plants, within a plant over time, and in various parts of a plant.

## Healing Properties

- **Antiproliferative**
  - Citrus Pectin fragments such as, rhamnogalacturonan, exhibit high anti-proliferation activities against human colon adenocarcinoma (colon cancer) cells.[^1]
- **Prebiotic:** Promotes increase of beneficial bacteria in gut microbiota.
- Reduces blood cholesterol levels.

## Disease / Symptom Treatment
- **Cancer**
  - **Colon Adenocarcinoma (colon cancer):** Citrus Pectin fragments such as, rhamnogalacturonan, inhibit cancer cell proliferation.[^1]
- **Hypercholesterolemia:** Helps reduce high levels of cholesterol in the blood.

The samples were prepared from citrus high and low methoxy pectins (HPE and LPE) by endo-α-D-(1,4)-polygalacturonase action coupling with a green process as ultrafiltration (membrane molecular weight cut off > 10k, 1k-10k, and < 1k, giving fragment preparations I, II, and III, respectively). It is indicated that, in the fragment preparations HPE-I, II, and III, the molecular fractions HPE-F1 (RG-I), HPE-F2 (RG-II), and HPE-F3 (GAOS) showed an averaged Mw = 26.7k, 3.4k, and 0.3k, respectively, notably higher than their LPE counterparts. All fragment preparations exhibited concentration-dependent, inhibition effects on Caco-2 cells, where HPE-II (RG-II-domain) revealed an interesting inhibition effect, significantly higher than those did HPE-I (RG-I domain) and HPE-III (GAOS). The HPE-F2 (RG-II) was elucidated and found of IR = 88% at 1.0 mg/mL and half-inhibition concentration (IC50) = 0.12 mg/mL, doubling the effect of HPE-F1 (RG-I) (IR = 45% at 1.0 mg/mL). Conclusively, citrus RG-II fragment showed a promisingly high anti-Caco-2 activity, significantly higher than did RG-I and GAOS, possibly attributed to its special branched structure and low molecular size.</i><br>**Link:** [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2018.05.017](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2018.05.017)<br>**Citations:**
