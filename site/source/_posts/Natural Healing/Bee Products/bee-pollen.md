**Bee Pollen** refers to the fermented pellets of flower pollen gathered and packed by honeybees.  The pollen undergoes a fermentation process when mixed with saliva secretions from the bees.  This fermentation process, helps break down the walls of flower pollen grains to make the nutrients more bio-available.

Bee pollen is also called bee bread or ambrosia.
