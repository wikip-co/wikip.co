**Flaxseed Oil**, also known as linseed oil or flax oil, is an edible oil obtained from the dried, ripened seeds of the flax plant.

## Composition

### α-Linolenic Acid
Flaxseed oil has been recognized as one of several foods rich in α-linolenic acid.[^1]

- α-linolenic acid has been reported to have anti-inflammatory and hypolipidemic effects.

## Healing Properties

### Digetsion

## Disease / Symptom Treatment

### Irritable Bowel Syndrome

Consumption of flaxseed oil can relax both constipation and diarrhea.[^1]

### Fatty Liver Disease

Consumption of flaxseed oil can prevent against alcoholic hepatic steatosis.
- By ameliorating lipid homeostasis at the adipose tissue-liver axis, thereby improving the lipid profile.

## Adverse Affects

## Synergistic Effects

The aim of present study was to investigate the effect of flaxseed oil on ulcerative colitis. The rats were gavaged daily with flaxseed oil at doses of 400, 800 and 1600 mg/kg b.w. for six weeks, while ulcerative colitis was induced by daily administrating with 3% (w/v) dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) on the sixth week. Results showed that the rats fed with flaxseed oil had less disease activity index, colon weight, colon weight/length ratio and colon cell damage. Flaxseed oil consumption relieved the oxidative condition, reduced colon inflammation and partly restored the microbiota change by DSS. Flaxseed oil (1600 mg/kg b.w.) has a great potential in prevention of ulcerative colitis possibly by regulating the oxidative condition, inflammatory factors and cecal microbiota.</i><br>**Link:** [Source](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2019.103602)<br>**Citations:**
