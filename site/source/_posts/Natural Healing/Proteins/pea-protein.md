**Pea protein isolate (PPI)** is a dietary supplement created by separating out the other components from peas and extracting the protein fragments, making them into a heterogenous powder. Peas are the pod fruit from the Pisum sativum plant (most common).

## Composition

## Preparation

## Healing Properties

### Antioxidant

Phenolic compounds with antioxidant capacity are present in the seed coat and cotyledon of peas.[^1]

The antioxidant activity of pea protein-derived peptides represents improved linoleic acid oxidation inhibition.[^1]

### Chelation

Pea protein-derived peptides have demonstrated metal chelating capacity.[^1]

### Bone Health

Research has demonstrated the presence of bioactive peptides in pea protein that can positively modulate the activity of osteoblasts, indicating the potential of pea derived peptides for the prevention or treatment of osteoporosis.[^1]

### ACE Inhibitor

(Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor)

ACE Inhibitors are used for the treatment of high blood pressure and heart failure. They work by causing relaxation of blood vessels as well as a decrease in blood volume, which leads to lower blood pressure and decreased oxygen demand from the heart.

"Blood pressure in the human body is regulated by the renin-angiotensin system in which angiotensin II acts as a vasoconstrictor with renin and angiotensin-converting enzyme as two important enzymes.[^1]"

Two fractions extracted from pea protein showed a significant ACE inhibitory property indicating the ability of pea protein derived peptide in treating hypertension.[^1]


## Disease / Symptom Treatment

### Hypertension

Two fractions extracted from pea protein showed a significant ACE inhibitory property indicating the ability of pea protein derived peptide in treating hypertension.[^1]
