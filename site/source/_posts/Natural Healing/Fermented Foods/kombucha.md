**Kombucha** is a fermented, lightly effervescent, sweetened black or green tea drink. Juice, spices, fruit and other flavorings are often added to the beverage.

## Healing Properties

### Antioxidant

### Metabolism

Kombuchas from green and black teas have bioactive properties that can help control metabolic alterations induced by a high-fat high-fructose (HFHF) diet.[^1]

### Blood Sugar Regulation

Improved glucose metabolism.[^1]

Improved plasma total antioxidant capacity and superoxide dismutase activity.[^1]

### Vascular Health

Decreased nitric oxide concentration.[^1]

### Antiinflammatory

Kombucha reduced systemic inflammation by decreasing the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR).[^1]

### Weight Loss

Reduced total adipose tissue.[^1]

Reduced blood triglycerides.[^1]

Reverted liver steatosis.[^1]

Modulation of genes related to adipogenesis and Î²-oxidation.[^1]
