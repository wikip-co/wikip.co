**Resveratrol** is a type of natural phenol produced by several plants. 

## Healing Properties

### Antiaging

Resveratrol mimics the antioxidant and antiaging effects of caloric restriction.[^5]

### Anticancer

Resveratrol inhibits the growth of human gastric carcinoma cells.[^3]

### Antiinflammatory

Resveratrol can be used as an anti-inflammatory nutraceutical.[^14]

### Anti-Oxidant (antioxidant)

### Anti-Angiogenic

blocks cancer blood vessel growth.

### Brain Health

#### Cognitive enhancement

#### Neuroprotective

Resveratrol may prevent neuronal death, stop amyloid deposition, and promote blood brain barrier inegrity.[^8]

Resveratrol treatment has been shown to preserve the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients. Resveratrol also induced adaptive immune responses that promoted brain resilience to amyloid deposition. Resveratrol may slow cognitive decline in AD, and may arrest neuronal death. Resveratrol may seal off a leaky blood brain barrier and contribute to cognitive and functional improvement.[^8]

### Vascular Health

Resveratrol has been shown to improve biomarkers related to vascular functions.[^6]

The vascular-related effects of resveratrol include:[^10]

- Suppression of platelet aggregation
- Inhibition of low-density lipoprotein oxidation
- Activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)
- Inhibition of leukocyte adhesion
- Inhibition of tissue factor expression 
- Reduction in vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 expression.

Resveratrol improves vessel responsiveness (especially when taken in conjunction with 40 mins of regular daily exercise).[^6]

#### Endothelial Health

Resveratrol promotes **endothelium-independent** relaxation of thoracic aorta.[^6]

### Gut Health (Digestive Health)

Helps modulate gut microbiota.

- Promotes neuroprotection in the myenteric plexus (myenteric plexus is the major nerve supply to the gastrointestinal tract and controls GI tract motility).[^7]
- Antioxidant effect in the intestinal wall.[^7]

### Heart Health

Resveratrol and regular aerobic exercise improves vascular functions and biomarkers related to vessel responsiveness.[^6]

### Kidney Health

Reduces renal oxidative stress.

### Metabolism

Beverages Rich in Resveratrol and Physical Activity Attenuate Metabolic Changes Induced by High-Fat Diet[^9]

> Saturated fats in the diet can cause deleterious effects on health, which could be minimized through physical activity and the consumtion of functional foods with  medicinal qualities.[^9]

Grape juice can help lower lipid peroxidation (fat oxidation), interleukin-6 (IL6) concentration and systolic blood pressure (SBP) while also positivley increasing healthy gut microbiota.[^9]

The consumption of grape juice, together with physical exercise, may be able to promote beneficial metabolic changes even in the presence of a traditional High Fat Diet.[^9]

## Disease / Symptom Treatment

### Allergies

### Birth Defects

#### Autism

Resveratrol can help prevent cellular and behavioral sensory alterations to the brain during fetal development.[^2]

### Cancer

#### Bladder Cancer

Resveratrol induces apoptosis associated with mitochondrial dysfunction in bladder carcinoma cells.
 
#### Cervical Cancer
 
Resveratrol can inhibit the occurrence and development of cervical cancer.[^4]

#### Gastric Cancer

Resveratrol induces apoptosis in human gastric carcinoma.[^3]

#### Pancreatic Cancer

Resveratrol induces apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells.

#### Prostate Cancer

Resveratrol enhances radiation sensitivity in prostate cancer by inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting cell senescence and apoptosis.

### Diabetes

Resveratrol may be promising for the treatment of damage in the enteric nervous system caused by diabetes (the enteric nervous system is embedded in the lining of the gastrointestinal system, beginning in the esophagus and extending down to the anus).[^7]

### Dysbiosis

Resveratrol prevents microbial imbalance, impaired microbiota[^1]

### Cardiovascular Disease

Resveratrol potentially inhibits several key steps in the atherogenic process and has a protective effect on cardiovascular disease.

#### Hypertension

Resveratrol can reduce renal (kidney) oxidative stress, activate nutrient-sensing signals, modulate gut microbiota, and prevent hypertension.[^1]

### Neurodegenerative Diseases

#### Alzheimer's Disease

- Resveratrol improves of proteostasis (prevents degradation and misfolding of proteins in the brain).[^5]
- Induces neuroprotection against amyloid and tau (neuro-fibrillary tangles) pathologies.[^5]
- Promotes brain resilience and defense against neurodegeneration caused by the accumulation of aberrant proteins.
- Resveratrol administration induced complete protection against memory loss and brain pathology in mice with Alzheimer's, and also induced cognitive enhancement in healthy mice.[^1]

Resveratrol for Alzheimer's may prevent neuronal death, stop amyloid deposition, and promote blood brain barrier inegrity.[^8]

Resveratrol treatment has been shown to preserve the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients. Resveratrol also induced adaptive immune responses that promoted brain resilience to amyloid deposition. Resveratrol may slow cognitive decline in AD, and may arrest neuronal death. Resveratrol may seal off a leaky blood brain barrier and contribute to cognitive and functional improvement.[^8]

#### Memory Loss

Resveratrol administration promotes complete protection against memory loss.[^5]

## Synergistic Effects

### Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)

#### Cell Protection (Helps prevent DNA damage)

- Resveratrol can significantly potentiate the cell protection and rescue effects of Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+).[^11] 
  - Resveratrol augments NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-1 (SIRT1).[^12]
    - SIRT1 protein, a member of Silent Information Regulator 2 (Sir2) protein family, is an epigenetic regulator.[^13]
    - Changes in sirtuin expression are critical in several diseases including metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, obesity, cancer and neurodegeneration.[^13]
    - SIRT1 regulates many endocrine functions, protects from oxidative stress-related cellular events, promotes DNA stability, and decreases various age-related disorders, such as neurodegenerative disease, metabolic abnormalities, and cancer.[^13]

Resveratrol has been independently shown to significantly protect cells from DNA-damaging agents and induced cell death.[^11]

The NAD+ precursors Nicotinic acid and Nicotinamide, when administered with Resveratrol significantly improved cell protection and rescue effects, plausibly due to increased intracellular NAD+ levels.[^11]
