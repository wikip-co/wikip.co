**Flavonoids** are the most diverse group of phytochemicals.

Flavonoids are divided into six classes: 

- Flavanols (flavan-3-ol)
- Flavanones
- Flavones
- Flavonols
- Isoflavonoids
- Anthocyanidins

## Citrus Flavonoids

### 8-Prenylnaringenin (8-PN)

8-Prenylnaringenin is a phytoestrogen. It is reported to be the most estrogenic phytoestrogen known.

8-prenylnaringenin is a natural compound, structurally belonging to the group of prenylated flavonoids.

It is notable compound in Hops (Humulus lupulus L.), a key ingredient for beer brewing.

Due to its estrogenic effects, 8-PN represents a novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of menopausal and post-menopausal symptoms that occur as a consequence of a progressive decline in hormone levels in women.[^1]

Application of 8-PN in the treatment of menopause has been clinically examined with promising results.[^1]

Other activities that have already been assessed include the potential to prevent bone-resorption or inhibition of tumor growth.[^1]

### Cosmosiin

### Diosmin

### Didymin

### Hesperetin

### Hesperidin

Hesperidin is a flavanone glycoside found in citrus fruits. Hesperidin was first isolated from the white inner layer of citrus peels (mesocarp) in 1828. Hesperidin is believed to play a role in plant defense.Hesperidin is a flavanone glycoside found in citrus fruits.

**Abstract:** Hop (Humulus lupulus L.), as a key ingredient for beer brewing, is also a source of many biologically active molecules. A notable compound, 8-prenylnaringenin (8-PN), structurally belonging to the group of prenylated flavonoids, was shown to be a potent phytoestrogen, and thus, became the topic of active research. Here, we overview the pharmacological properties of 8-PN and its therapeutic opportunities. Due to its estrogenic effects, administration of 8-PN represents a novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of menopausal and post-menopausal symptoms that occur as a consequence of a progressive decline in hormone levels in women. Application of 8-PN in the treatment of menopause has been clinically examined with promising results. Other activities that have already been assessed include the potential to prevent bone-resorption or inhibition of tumor growth. On the other hand, the use of phytoestrogens is frequently questioned regarding possible adverse effects associated with long-term consumption. In conclusion, we emphasize the implications of using 8-PN in future treatments of menopausal and post-menopausal symptoms, including the need for precise evidence and further investigations to define the safety risks related to its therapeutic use.<br>
