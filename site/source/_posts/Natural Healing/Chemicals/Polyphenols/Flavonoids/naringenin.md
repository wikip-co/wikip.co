## Healing Properties

### Antiadipogenic

Counters adipogenesis (The formation of fatty tissue; lipogenesis).[^2]

#### Weight Loss

A commercial polyphenolic extract from several Citrus fruits (Sinetrol-XPur), containing about 20% of naringenin, was tested in 95 healthy overweight volunteers (BMI ranging from 26 to 29.9 kg/m2). The main overweight-related endpoints were improved after 12-weeks randomized protocol (including waist and hip circumference, abdominal fat, body weight). Moreover, inflammatory and oxidative stress markers were all decreased.[^2]

- Naringenin promotes carbohydrate metabolism.[^2]

### Antiviral

Naringenin shows a dose-dependent inhibitory effect against dengue virus .[^2]

- Naringenin prevents intracellular replication of chikungunya virus.[^2]
- Naringenin inhibits assembly and long-term production of infectious hepatitis C virus particles in a dose-dependent manner.[^2]

### Brain Health

Naringenin is able to traverse the blood–brain barrier and to exert diverse neuronal effects

### Chemopreventive

### DNA Repair

Naringenin has the ability to repair DNA. Cells exposed to naringenin, for a duration of 24h, had a 24% reduction in DNA damages.[^2]

### Endothelial Health

Promotes vascular endothelial growth factor.[^1]

- Naringenin's ability to improve endothelial function has been well-established.[^2]
- Postprandial endothelial dysfunction was reduced, probably through a specific flavanone’s metabolites action on nitric oxide.[^2]
- In a very interesting trial, the long-term effect of 340 mL of grapefruit juice/day, containing about 480 μM naringenin glycoside, was investigated on endothelial function. From the 48 healthy menopausal women recruited, arterial stiffness beneficial effects were found 6 months after treatment (carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity was significantly reduced).[^2]

## Disease / Symptom Treatment

### Diabetes

#### Insulin Resistance

Naringenin potentiates intracellular signaling responses to low insulin doses by sensitizing hepatocytes to insulin.[^2]

-  Naringin improves overall insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance.[^3]

### Hepatitis C virus (HCV)

The Naringenin flavanone has been described to reduce HCV secretion in infected cells by 80%.[^2]

### Fatty Liver

Naringenin impairs lipid accumulation in liver and thereby prevents fatty liver.[^2]

In the present study, treatment with naringenin showed an inhibitory effect on SIV formation in zebrafish embryos, which demonstrates its potential anti-angiogenic activity. In a chemically-induced blood vessel loss model in zebrafish, we found that naringin exhibited remarkably pro-angiogenesis activity on the restoration of blood vessel loss, and significantly reversed VRI-induced down-regulation of flt1 mRNA expression. In an in vitro study of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), our results showed that naringin specifically promoted HUVEC migration but not proliferation. Taken together, these results suggest that naringin and naringenin have differential angiogenesis activities where naringin, as a novel angiogenic agent, has the potential to be developed as a therapeutic agent for diseases associated with insufficient angiogenesis, such as ischemia heart disease.</i><br>**Link:** [Source](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2018.08.010)<br>**Citations:**

It is widely distributed in several Citrus fruits, bergamot, tomatoes and other fruits, being also found in its glycosides form (mainly naringin). Several biological activities have been ascribed to this phytochemical, among them antioxidant, antitumor, antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antiadipogenic and cardioprotective effects. Nonetheless, most of the data reported have been obtained from in vitro or in vivo studies. Although some clinical studies have also been performed, the main focus is on naringenin bioavailability and cardioprotective action. In addition, these studies were done in compromised patients (i.e., hypercholesterolemic and overweight), with a dosage ranging between 600 and 800 μM/day, whereas the effect on healthy volunteers is still debatable. In fact, naringenin ability to improve endothelial function has been well-established. Indeed, the currently available data are very promising, but further research on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic aspects is encouraged to improve both available production and delivery methods and to achieve feasible naringenin-based clinical formulations.</i><br>**Link:** [Source](https://doi.org/10.3390/ph12010011)<br>**Citations:**

This review included a total of 31 studies (20 studies on humans with 1709 subjects and 11 in animals (rats and mice)). In humans, bergamot‐derived extract (BE) exerts positive effects on hyperlipidemia with an oral dose from 150 mg to 1000 mg/day of flavonoids administered from 30 to 180 days, demonstrating an effect on body weight and in modulating total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, and HDL. Studies in animals confirm promising data on glucose control (500/1000 mg/day of BE with a treatment lasting 30 days) are available in rats. In animals models, bergamot essential oil (BEO, 10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg daily for 20 weeks) increases bone volume, decreases psoriatic plaques, increases skin collagen content, and promotes hair growth. Bergamot juice (20 mg/kg) is promising in terms of pro‐inflammatory cytokine reduction. In humans, aromatherapy (from 15 to 30 min) does not appear to be useful in order to reduce stress, anxiety, and nausea, compared to placebo. Compared to baseline, BE topical application and BEO aromatherapy reduce blood diastolic and systolic pressure and could have a significant effect on improving mental conditions.</i><br>**Link:** [Source](https://doi.org/10.1002/fsn3.903)<br>**Citations:**
