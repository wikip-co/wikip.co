**Naringin**

## Healing Properties

### Antioxidant

Naringin exhibits strong antioxidant potential.

### Antibacterial

### Anti-Inflammatory

### Angiogenic

Naringin exhibited pro-angiogenesis activity on the restoration of blood vessel loss.[^4]

### Heart Health

#### Cardioprotective

Promotes optimal mitochondrial function in the heart muscle.[^3]

- Counteracts fructose-induced cardiomyocyte (heart muscle) apoptosis (cell death).[^3]
- Naringin is able to suppress mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mitochondrial dysfunction in cardiomyocytes (cardiac muscle cells) exposed to fructose.[^3]

#### Antiatherogenic

Prevents or inhibits atherogenesis (the formation of fatty plaques in the arteries).

- Prevents Cardiac hypertrophy (a thickening of the walls of the heart due to high sugar diet, caused by mitochondrial dysfunction).[^3]

### Immunomodulator

Modulates immune system activity.[^5]

### Lung Health

Naringin protects against acrolein-induced pulmonary injuries.[^1]

### Metabolism

A double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, involving 10 subjects per treatment group, showed that naringin is able to synergistically increase metabolic rate, without enhancing blood pressure and heart rates.[^5]

## Disease / Symptom Treatment

### Scar Formation (scar tissue) 

Naringin inhibits the development of **hypertrophic scars** (A hypertrophic scar is a cutaneous condition characterized by deposits of excessive amounts of collagen which gives rise to a raised scar).[^2]

- Naringin inhibits the growth and motility of fibroblasts.
- Naringin may be a new drug for the treatment of hypertrophic scars.[^2]

### Lung Cancer

### Heart Disease (Cardiovascular Disease) 

Naringin has the potential to be developed as a therapeutic agent for diseases associated with insufficient angiogenesis, such as ischemia heart disease.[^4]

Here we investigated the effects of naringin on acrolein induced-lung injuries in mice. Male C57BL/6 mice were allocated into four groups: Vehicle group (no acrolein), Naringin only group (80 mg of naringin/kg bw + no acrolein), Acrolein group (ACR group; acrolein), and Naringin + Acrolein group (NAG+ACR group; 80 mg of naringin/kg bw and acrolein). The mice were subjected acute acrolein inhalation (10 ppm for 12 h) in an inhalation chamber and naringin was intraperitoneally administered to the mice one hour before acrolein exposure. The results demonstrated that, in the NAG+ACR group, pulmonary injuries (e.g., airspace enlargement, lung inflammation) were all significantly improved compared to the ACR group. Further, key markers of MAPK signaling (e.g., p-p38, p-JNK), p53 signaling markers (e.g., p-Chk2, p53), NF-κB signaling axis (e.g., IL-1 β, TNF-α), and oxidative damage markers (e.g., GSSG:GSH ratio, oxidative DNA damage) were all effectively mitigated by the naringin treatment. Naringin provided protection against the environmental toxicant, acrolein, in mice lung via modulating MAPK, p53, and NF-κB signaling pathways and our data may provide significant implications considering the prevalence of acrolein.</i><br>**Link:** [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2018.05.012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2018.05.012)<br>**Citations:**

In this article, we first proved that naringin could inhibit the proliferation of fibroblasts by MTT experiments. Flow cytometry indicated that naringin could block the cell cycle and promote apoptosis. Transwell experiments showed that naringin could inhibit the motility activity of fibroblasts. We also found that naringin specifically inhibits the kinase activity of Akt and the phosphorylation of Akt in hypertrophic scar fibroblasts by Kinase-Glo, western blot and real-time PCR assays. Subsequently, western blots and real-time PCR indicated that naringin can inhibit phosphorylation of Akt and downstream proteins of Akt. Our data demonstrated that naringin inhibits the development of hypertrophic scars, at least to a certain extent, by its inhibition of Aktp.</i><br>**Link:** [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2018.06.103](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2018.06.103)<br>**Citations:**

Recent increase in dietary fructose consumption mirrors the rise in prevalence of cardiovascular diseases such as cardiac hypertrophy leading to concerns raised by public health experts. Mitochondria, comprising 30% of cardiomyocyte volume, play a central role in modulating redox-dependent cellular processes such as metabolism and apoptosis. Furthermore, mitochondrial dysfunction is a key cause of pathogenesis of fructose-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Naringin, a major flavanone glycoside in citrus species, has displayed strong antioxidant potential in models of oxidative stress. In this study, we evaluated protective effects of naringin against fructose-induced cardiac hypertrophy and associated mechanisms of action, using in vitro and in vivo models. We found that naringin suppressed mitochondrial ROS production and mitochondrial dysfunction in cardiomyocytes exposed to fructose and consequently reduced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy by regulating AMPK-mTOR signaling axis. Furthermore, naringin counteracted fructose-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and this function of naringin was linked to its ability to inhibit ROS-dependent ATM-mediated p53 signaling. This result was supported by observations in in vivo mouse model of cardiac hypertrophy. These findings indicate a novel role for naringin in protecting against fructose-induced cardiac hypertrophy and suggest unique therapeutic strategies for prevention of cardiovascular diseases.</i><br>**Link:** [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-27788-1](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-27788-1)<br>**Citations:**

In the present study, treatment with naringenin showed an inhibitory effect on SIV formation in zebrafish embryos, which demonstrates its potential anti-angiogenic activity. In a chemically-induced blood vessel loss model in zebrafish, we found that naringin exhibited remarkably pro-angiogenesis activity on the restoration of blood vessel loss, and significantly reversed VRI-induced down-regulation of flt1 mRNA expression. In an in vitro study of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), our results showed that naringin specifically promoted HUVEC migration but not proliferation. Taken together, these results suggest that naringin and naringenin have differential angiogenesis activities where naringin, as a novel angiogenic agent, has the potential to be developed as a therapeutic agent for diseases associated with insufficient angiogenesis, such as ischemia heart disease.</i><br>**Link:** [Source](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2018.08.010)<br>**Citations:**

It is widely distributed in several Citrus fruits, bergamot, tomatoes and other fruits, being also found in its glycosides form (mainly naringin). Several biological activities have been ascribed to this phytochemical, among them antioxidant, antitumor, antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antiadipogenic and cardioprotective effects. Nonetheless, most of the data reported have been obtained from in vitro or in vivo studies. Although some clinical studies have also been performed, the main focus is on naringenin bioavailability and cardioprotective action. In addition, these studies were done in compromised patients (i.e., hypercholesterolemic and overweight), with a dosage ranging between 600 and 800 μM/day, whereas the effect on healthy volunteers is still debatable. In fact, naringenin ability to improve endothelial function has been well-established. Indeed, the currently available data are very promising, but further research on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic aspects is encouraged to improve both available production and delivery methods and to achieve feasible naringenin-based clinical formulations.</i><br>**Link:** [Source](https://doi.org/10.3390/ph12010011)<br>**Citations:**

This review included a total of 31 studies (20 studies on humans with 1709 subjects and 11 in animals (rats and mice)). In humans, bergamot‐derived extract (BE) exerts positive effects on hyperlipidemia with an oral dose from 150 mg to 1000 mg/day of flavonoids administered from 30 to 180 days, demonstrating an effect on body weight and in modulating total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, and HDL. Studies in animals confirm promising data on glucose control (500/1000 mg/day of BE with a treatment lasting 30 days) are available in rats. In animals models, bergamot essential oil (BEO, 10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg daily for 20 weeks) increases bone volume, decreases psoriatic plaques, increases skin collagen content, and promotes hair growth. Bergamot juice (20 mg/kg) is promising in terms of pro‐inflammatory cytokine reduction. In humans, aromatherapy (from 15 to 30 min) does not appear to be useful in order to reduce stress, anxiety, and nausea, compared to placebo. Compared to baseline, BE topical application and BEO aromatherapy reduce blood diastolic and systolic pressure and could have a significant effect on improving mental conditions.</i><br>**Link:** [Source](https://doi.org/10.1002/fsn3.903)<br>**Citations:**
