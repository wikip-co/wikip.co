## Safety[^7]

## Healing Properties

### Anti-Carcinogenic (anticancer)

#### Antiproliferative

Quercetin has demonstrated antiproliferative activity against colon and breast cancer cells.[^3]

- Treatment of quercetin had reduced the proliferation rates of colon HCT116 and breat MDA-MB-231 cancer cells.[^3]

#### Cancer chemopreventive agent

Treatment with quercetin dihydrate has been shown to promote the killing activity of T cells on cancer cells.[^6]

The growth rate of tumor volumes and masses treated with quercetin dihydrate were decreased.[^6]

### Anti-Inflammatory

Strong antiinflammatory activity.[^1]

### Anti-Infective 

### Antioxidant

Quercetin is one of the most potent antioxidants of plant origin.[^1]

Quercetin has direct radical scavenging action.[^1]

### Brain Health

#### Neuroprotective

Several in-vitro studies have reported that quercetin demonstrates neuroprotection.[^1]

Quercetin's metabolites after absorption have all been shown to afford neuroprotection as well.[^1]

Quercetin protects against progressive dopaminergic neurodegeneration.[^1]

#### Neuroregeneration

Quesrcetin stimulates neuronal regeneration.[^1]

##### Antioxidant

It has been shown to protect neurons from oxidative damage while reducing lipid peroxidation.[^1]

##### Anti-Inflammatory / Anti-Amyloid Fibrils

In addition to its antioxidant properties, it inhibits the fibril formation of amyloid-β proteins, counteracting cell lyses and inflammatory cascade pathways.[^1]

- Suppresses neuroinflammatory processes by downregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines.[^1]
- Prevents the degradation of acetylcholine, and decreases Aβ production.[^1]

#### Cognitive performance

Quercetin restores acetylcholine levels through the inhibition of hydrolysis of acetylcholine by AChE enzyme.[^1]

##### Memory Enhancer

Quercetin and rutin have been reported to function as memory enhancers in scopolamine-induced memory impairment tests, thus possibly enhancing cholinergic neurotransmission.[^1]

##### Psychostimulant

### Heart Health / Cardiovascular Health

#### Antiinflammatory

Quercetin Attenuates Atherosclerotic Inflammation[^4]

#### Anti-Atherogenic

Quercetin inhibits atherogenesis (hardening/narrowing of the arteries).[^4]

### Blood Health

Inhibits platelet aggregation.[^1]

### Metabolism

#### Energy Production / Mitochondrial Health

Quercetin protects against mitochondrial dysfunction.[^1]

Quercetin stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis.[^1]

- Quercetin ameliorates mitochondrial dysfunction by restoring mitochondrial membrane potential, decreases ROS
production, and restores ATP synthesis.[^1]
- It also increases the expression of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is a key cell regulator of energy metabolism.[^1]

## Disease / Symptom Treatment

### Cancer

Quercetin dihydrate has the exciting potential to be used as a cancer chemopreventive agent. Treatment with quercetin dihydrate has been shown to promote the killing activity of T cells on cancer cells.[^6]

The growth rate of tumor volumes and masses treated with quercetin dihydrate were decreased.[^6]

### Neurodegenerative Diseases

Quercetin Disaggregates Prion Fibrils and Decreases Fibril-Induced Cytotoxicity and Oxidative Stress.[^2]

#### Neuroinflammation

Reducing the neuroinflammatory events in microglia might afford a beneficial strategy for the
prevention of the progression of inflammatory-mediated neurodegenerative disorders.[^1]

Quercetin has been reported to have anti-inflammatory actions, and is a suitable candidate among phytochemicals for future studies on its efficacy to reverse neuroinflammation.[^1]

Quercetin has been shown to inhibit neuroinflammation by reducing nitric oxide production, iNOS gene expression in microglia, the production of inflammatory cytokines, as well as a reduction
in cytokine expression as reported from in vivo studies.[^1]

#### Alzheimer's Disease (AD)

- Reverses histopathological hallmarks of AD[^1]
- Improves motor function[^1]
- Reduces α-synuclein fibrillization[^1]
- Reduces hippocampal neuronal cell death[^1]
- Improves synaptic plasticity[^1]
- Quercetin has shown therapeutic efficacy, improving learning, memory, and cognitive functions in
AD.[^1]
- Quercetin administration reverses extracellular β-amyloidosis and decreases tauopathies, astrogliosis, and microgliosis in the hippocampus and amygdale, thus protecting cognitive and emotional function in age triple transgenic Alzheimer’s disease model.[^1]

Quercetin interferes with the formation of neurotoxic oligomeric Aβ species and displays fibril destabilizing effects on preformed fibrillar Aβ, reversing Aβ-induced neurotoxicity.[^1]

#### Parkinson's Disease

##### Dopaminergic Neurodegeneration

Quercetin protects against progressive dopaminergic neurodegeneration.[^1]

#### Cognitive Impairment

#### Ischemia

#### Traumatic injury (brain/spinal)

Isoquercetin improved motor functions in acute spinal cord injury.[^1]

#### Huntington’s disease

## Synergistic Effects

### Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)

#### Cell Protection (Helps prevent DNA damage)

Quercetin can significantly potentiate the cell protection and rescue effects of Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+).[^5]

Quercetin has been independently shown to significantly protect cells from DNA-damaging agents and induced cell death.[^5]

The NAD+ precursors Nicotinic acid and Nicotinamide, when administered with Quercetin significantly improved cell protection and rescue effects, plausibly due to increased intracellular NAD+ levels.[^5]
