**Theabrownin** is one of the most active and abundant pigments in Pu-erh tea.

## Healing Properties

### Antiobesity

Theabrownin was shown to reduce body weight and improve lipid and glucose disorders caused by a High Fat Diet.[^1]

### Thermogenesis

Theabrownin was shown to efficiently promote thermogenesis.[^1]

Theabrownin promoted the expression of thermogenic and mitochondrial genes.[^1]

### Fat Metaboliism

Long-term consumption of Theabrownin can enhance brown adipose tissue activity and white adipose tissue browning.[^1]

Brown adipose (fat) tissue is a special type of body fat that produces heat to help maintain your body temperature in cold conditions. Brown fat contains many more mitochondria than does white fat. These mitochondria are the "engines" in brown fat that burn calories to produce heat. Brown fat appears to be able to use regular body fat as fuel.


### Antiinflammatory

Inflammation was reduced in interscapular Brown Adipose Tissue, inguinal White Adipose Tissue, and epididymis white adipose tissue.[^1]

### Digestion

Improvement in the intestinal homeostasis by improving Short Chain Fatty Acids, especially butyric acid levels was related to thermogenic and antiinflammatory factors.[^1]

### Cholesterol Lowering

### Digestion

Theabrownin modulates Short Chain Fatty Acids.[^1]
