**Vitamin C**

## Healing Properties

### Muscle Retention

Positive associations, of both dietary and circulating vitamin C with measures of skeletal muscle mass in middle- and older-aged men and women, suggest that dietary vitamin C intake may be useful for reducing age-related muscle loss.[^1]

### Skin Health

#### Collagen Production

Vitamin C is associated with significantly increased collagen production.[^2]

- Method of action: increased mRNA expression of procollagen and elastin in fibroblasts.[^2]

## Disease / Symptom Treatment

### Sarcopenia

> Sarcopenia is characterized by a progressive and generalized loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength.

Studies have shown significant positive associations between both dietary and circulating vitamin C and measures of skeletal muscle in a large cohort of free-living middle- and older-aged men and women.[^1]

> Ensuring sufficient dietary vitamin C intake, by promoting a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, may help to reduce age-related loss of skeletal muscle and thus have wide-reaching public health benefit.[^1]
