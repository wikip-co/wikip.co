**Lipoic acid** is an organosulfur compound which is essential for aerobic metabolism.

Also known as α-lipoic acid (α-LA), alpha lipoic acid (ALA) and thioctic acid.

Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is synthesized enzymatically in human cells and regulates the mitochondrial enzymes as cofactor.[^2]

## Composition

## Healing Properties

### Antiinflammatory

### Antitumor

ALA improved the anticancer potential of several NSAIDs. (NSAIDs can stimulate apoptosis and inhibit angiogenesis, and reduce tumor growth)

### Brain Health

α-Lipoic Acid is a therapeutic agent against neuroinflammatory responses.

Alpha-Lipoic Acid has been suggested to have anti-dementia and anti-Alzheimer's Disease properties due to several actions, such as scavenging the reactive oxygen species (ROS), reducing inflammatory processes, and regenerating endogenous antioxidants.[^1]

### Metal Chelating Activity

## Disease / Symptom Treatment

### Brain Cancer

#### Glioblastoma

Alpha Lipoic Acid improved the anticancer potential of several NSAIDs when tested against human gioblastoma cell lines.

Alpha Lipoic Acid is well known to exert its antitumor activities in different cell lines by apoptosis-mediated mechanisms.[^2]

### Diabetes

### Dementia

### Alzheimer's Disease

## Adverse Affects

## Synergistic Effects

ALA improved the anticancer potential of several NSAIDs. (NSAIDs have been shown to stimulate apoptosis and inhibit angiogenesis, and reduce tumor growth).[^2]
