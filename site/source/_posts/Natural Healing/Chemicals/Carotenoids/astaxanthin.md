**Astaxanthin** is a keto-carotenoid. It belongs to a larger class of chemical compounds known as terpenes built from five carbon precursors, isopentenyl diphosphate, and dimethylallyl diphosphate.

## Healing Properties

### Antiaging

### Antioxidant

Astaxanthin is the most powerful natural carotenoid antioxidant.[^1]

#### Brain Antioxidant

Astaxanthin suppresses oxidative stress in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.[^8]

### Antiinflammatory

Astaxanthin decreases oxidative stress and inflammatory response in cells.[^1]

#### Neuroinflammation

Astaxanthin could regulate the expression of inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.[^8]

### Anticancer

Astaxanthin works together with Human serum albumin (the most abundant protein in blood plasma) to fight cancer at a cellular level.[^4]

#### Anti-Apoptotic (anti-apoptosis)

#### Antiproliferative

Astaxanthin was shown to prevent cell proliferation, Migration, And drug-resistance in human ovarian carcinoma cells.[^4]

Astaxanthin induced apoptosis in carcinoma cells via mitochondrial apoptotic pathways.[^4]

### Cardioprotective

Astaxanthin is beneficial for ischemic-reperfusion of clogged arteries to help restore blood flow.[^1]

### Immunomodulator (Immune Response)

### Mental Wellness (mental health)

Astaxanthin supplementation improves global mood state and supports mental wellness in healthy subjects.[^2]

### Neuroprotection (neuroprotective)

Astaxanthin's antioxidant properties provide powerful neuroprotection.

- Short-term (7-day) treatment with astaxanthin demonstrated a protective effect on glial and neuronal alterations.[^5]
  - **glia** are the connective tissue of the nervous system, they are associated with **neurons** which are the nerve cells.

Astaxanthin has been shown to prevent hippocampal structural damage, to a certain extent.[^8]

### Renal Health

Astaxanthin can increase peritubular capillary density (peritubular capillaries are tiny blood vessels in the renal system).[^3]

- Astaxanthin upregulates vascular endothelial growth factor and downregulates thrombospondin levels.[^3]

### Skin Health

#### Photoprotective / UV Protection

In human keratinocytes, astaxanthin effectively protected against UV-induced inflammation.[^9]

### Vision (eyesight)

Patients treated with lutein/zeaxanthin and astaxanthin together with antioxidants nutrients were more likely to report clinically meaningful stabilization/improvements in Visual Acuity, Contrast Sensitivity, and visual function through 24 months compared with non-treated subjects.[^7]

## Disease / Symptom Treatment

### Chemotherapy

#### Retinal Toxicity

Retinal toxicity refers to toxicity of the retina in the eyes.

The astaxanthin molecule is a promising option to prevent retinal toxicity in patients receiving the antineoplastic (anti-cancer) agent, Cisplatin as treatment for malignant tumors.[^6]

- Astaxanthin treatment reduced the increases in MDA, eNOS, and 8-OHdG levels following CIS administration and increased the levels of GSH expressions, as well.[^6]

### Depression

Natural astaxanthin supplementation reduces negative mood state (depression and fatigue) and improves global mood state and thus supports mental wellness in healthy subjects.[^2]

- Significant improvements were found with Natural astaxanthin treatment for positive mood state.[^2]

### Diabetes

#### Dyslipidemia

#### Vision Loss

The carotenoid Astaxanthin can confer a rapid antioxidant protective effect to the retina.[^5]

- A high-fat diet and obesity coupled with type 2 diabetes can cause a condition called non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.  This is the most common cause of vision loss among people with diabetes.

Short-term treatment with astaxanthin has been shown to prevent glial dysfunction in the diabetic retina.[^5]

Astaxanthin's antioxidant and neuroprotective properties can help attenuate the Retinal Changes caused by diabetic retinopathy.[^5]

- Diabetic retinopathy affects blood vessels in the light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye (the retina).  The blood vessels swell and develop balloon-like micro-aneurysms that leak fluid into the retina.

### Fatigue

Astaxanthin reduces depression and fatigue in healthy subjects

Natural astaxanthin (NAX) supplementation reduces negative mood state parameters (depression and fatigue) and improves global mood state and thus supports mental wellness. A total of 28 healthy subjects, half male and half female, with a median age of 42, supplemented with 12 mg per day of NAX or placebo. After an 8-week supplementation period, significant improvements were found in global mood state and related subscales: Vigor, Tension, Depression, Anger, Fatigue, and Confusion.

### Heart Disease

#### Heart Attack

#### Hypertension

### Vascular Dementia

Astaxanthin could alleviate the morphological impairment caused by Vascular Demetia.[^8]

- After Astaxanthin treatment, the damage of neurons was alleviated, showing remarkable improvement, with orderly arrangement of cells and large and clear nucleus.[^8]

#### Cognitive Impairment

Astaxanthin could improve non-spatial cognitive function.[^8]

##### Spatial Cognition Impairment

Astaxanthin might ameliorate impairment of spatial acquired function to a certain extent.[^8]

### Renal Interstitial Fibrosis

**Anti-Fibrotic:** Astaxanthin has been shown to attenuate renal interstitial fibrosis and peritubular capillary rarefaction via inactivation of the TGF‑β1/Smad signaling pathway.[^3]

### Nicotine-induced Toxicity

Astaxanthin protects the organs against the toxic effects of nicotine.[^1]

- Nicotine can cause harmful effects on the male testes potentially impacting fertility. Astaxanthin demonstrated a protective effect on these organs.[^1]
  - Astaxanthin reversed the negative effects of nicotine.[^1]

### Vision Loss

#### Age Related Macular Degeneration

- Astaxanthin can be used as a supplementary medication for dry type-age related macular degeneration patients.[^6]
