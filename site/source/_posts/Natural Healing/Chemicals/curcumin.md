## Healing Properties

### Bone Health

## Disease / Symptom Treatment

### Osteoperosis

Curcumin protects bones from osteoporosis, helps regulate blood glucose/lipid levels.

Curcumin significantly improved bone biomechanical properties (maximum load, breaking load, elastic load and the bone rigidity coefficient) and preserved bone microarchitecture. The present results also indicated that Curcumin regulated lipid (total cholesterol, triglyceride and lowâ€‘density lipoprotein) and fasting blood glucose levels.
