**Grape Seed Extract**

## Composition

### Polyphenols

- Catechin and Epicatechin
  - There are specially manufactured catechin-rich versions of Grape Seed Extact which are engineered to contain high concentrations of monomeric catechins.
- Catechin (C)
- Epicatechin gallate (ECG)
- Procyanidin B1
- Procyanidin B2
- Procyanidin C1

## Healing Properties

### Antioxidant

### Anti-Obesity

### Lung Health

Grape seed extract has been shown to increase the content of glycogen (a form of energy storage, the main storage form of glucose in the body).[^1]

#### Protects Lung Tissue

Grape Seed Extract has been shown to improve alternations in the lung tissue ultrastructures.[^1]

### Liver Health

Extract of grape seed has the ability to reduce toxic effects on the liver.

### Kidney Health

Extract of grape seed has the ability to reduce toxic effects on the kidneys.

### Cardiovascular Health

Extract of grape seed has the ability to reduce toxic effects on the heart.

## Disease / Symptom Treatment

### Lung Damage

Grape seed extract has an ameliorative effect against pulmonary damage.[^1]

- Grape seed extract has been shown to reduce the extent of lung damage.[^1]

### Diabetes

Grape Seed extract contains catechins which have anti-diabetic properties.[^2]

#### Glucose Regulation

(Carbohydrate Digestion, Glucosidase inhibitor)

The Catechins and procyanidins found in grape seed extract strongly inhibit α-amylase and α-glucosidase activity (these are glucosidases required for starch digestion). The effect of this inhibition is to help reduce the flow of glucose from complex dietary carbohydrates into the bloodstream, diminishing the postprandial (after eating) effect of starch consumption on blood glucose levels.[^2]

Grape seed extract strongly inhibits both α-amylase and α-glucosidase activity, with equal and much higher potency, respectively, than acarbose (a pharmacological glucosidase inhibitor).[^2]
