**Sesame seeds** come from the flowering plant Sesamum indicum.

## Composition

Sesame has one of the highest oil contents of any seed.

Sesame seeds have lignan contents several times higher than other dietary sources.[^1]

The lignan concentrations in sesame seeds (almost 29 mg/100 g, principally pinoresinol and 119 lariciresinol) are relatively high. 

Sesamin as a furofuran-type lignan, one of the main lignan compositions in sesame, is present in the seeds in amounts of 0.1-0.5%. Sesamin, can also be converted by intestinal microbiota to the mammalian lignans which may have protective effects against hormone-related diseases such as breast cancer.[^1]

Sesaminol is a furofuran that is cis-tetrahydro-1H,3H-furo[3,4-c]furan substituted by a 6-hydroxy-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl group at position 1S and a 1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl group at position 4S. It is metabolite found in sesame seeds.

## Healing Properties

### Antioxidant

Sesame ingestion benefits postmenopausal women by improving antioxidant status, blood lipids, and sex hormone status.[^1]

## Disease / Symptom Treatment

### Parkinson's Disease

Sesaminol has a preventative effect on Parkinson's Disease.[^2]
