## Description

The `/etc` folder is a central location for all configuration files of a Linux/Unix machine.[^1]

### Background

In most UNIX OS environments there is a folder designated for each type of data. For example, a `/bin` folder for all executable **bin**aries, a `/boot` folder for all **boot**ing related information, and a `/dev` folder for all hardware **dev**ices attached to the machine.[^1]

The `/etc` folder was originally designated for storing a mixture of config files, data files, socket files, and other files; therefore it was named `/etc` which is the abbreviated form of the latin expression, "et cetera."[^1]

As time passed the meaning of this folder has changed but not the name `/etc`.[^1]

## `/etc` folder contents

The contents of the `/etc` folder can be divided into the following groups.[^2]
