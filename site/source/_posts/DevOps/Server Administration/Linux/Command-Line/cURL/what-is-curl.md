### Description

cURL is a computer software project providing a library (libcurl) and command-line tool (curl) for transferring data using various network protocols. The name stands for "Client URL", which was first released in 1996.

### History

It was originally named `httpget` and then became `urlget` before adopting the current name of `curl`.  The original author and lead developer is the Swedish developer Daniel Stenberg, who created cURL because he wanted to automate the fetching of currency exchange rates for IRC users.
