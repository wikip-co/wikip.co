## Description

`etcd` is pronounced **/ˈɛtsiːdiː/**, and means “distributed etc directory.”[^1]

`etcd` is a distributed, reliable key-value store for the most critical data of a distributed system.[^1]

`etcd` is a strongly consistent, distributed key-value store that provides a reliable way to store data that needs to be accessed by a distributed system or cluster of machines. It gracefully handles leader elections during network partitions and can tolerate machine failure, even in the leader node. [^1

`etcd` is a consistent distributed key-value store. Mainly used as a separate coordination service, in distributed systems. And designed to hold small amounts of data that can fit entirely in memory.[^1]
