The **OSI model** (Open Systems Interconnection model) is a conceptual framework used to understand and design how data is transmitted over a network. It divides the networking process into **seven distinct layers**, each with specific roles and responsibilities. Think of it as a universal language for computer networking.

---

### **Application Layer (Layer 7)**
- **Purpose**: Interface for end-user processes and applications.
- **Examples**: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS
- **Analogy**: The app youâ€™re using (like a web browser).

---

### **Presentation Layer (Layer 6)**
- **Purpose**: Translates data formats, encryption/decryption, compression.
- **Examples**: SSL/TLS, JPEG, MPEG
- **Analogy**: The translator that makes sure both ends understand the data (e.g., translating from English to French).

---

### **Session Layer (Layer 5)**
- **Purpose**: Manages connections (sessions) between applications.
- **Examples**: NetBIOS, RPC
- **Analogy**: A moderator keeping a conversation on track and orderly.

---

### **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**
- **Purpose**: Reliable data transfer with error checking, flow control.
- **Examples**: TCP, UDP
- **Analogy**: A delivery truck ensuring your packages are sent and received in order.

---

### **Network Layer (Layer 3)**
- **Purpose**: Routing, addressing, and delivering packets between networks.
- **Examples**: IP, ICMP, IPsec
- **Analogy**: GPS or map used by the delivery truck to find the right address.

---

### **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**
- **Purpose**: Provides reliable data transfer across the physical link. Handles MAC addressing.
- **Examples**: Ethernet, PPP, MAC addresses
- **Analogy**: The street address or apartment number on the envelope.

---

### **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**
- **Purpose**: Transmits raw bits over physical medium (electrical, light, radio).
- **Examples**: Cables, switches, radio signals
- **Analogy**: The actual wires or Wi-Fi signals that carry the envelope.
