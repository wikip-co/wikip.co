## **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**
- **Purpose**: Transmits raw bits over physical medium (electrical, light, radio).
- **Examples**: Cables, switches, radio signals
- **Analogy**: The actual wires or Wi-Fi signals that carry the envelope.

## Examples

The Physical layer is responsible for:

- Transmission and reception of raw bit streams
- Hardware components (cables, antennas, transceivers)
- Environmental influences (moisture, EMI, etc.)
