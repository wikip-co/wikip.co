## Description

Vagrant is an open-source software product for building and maintaining portable virtual software development environments; e.g., for VirtualBox, KVM, Hyper-V, Docker containers, VMware, and AWS.

It tries to simplify the software configuration management of virtualization in order to increase development productivity.

Vagrant is written in the Ruby language, but its ecosystem supports development in a few other languages.

Vagrant runs on the following operating system: Debian, CentOS, Arch Linux, Linux, FreeBSD, macOS, and Microsoft Windows
