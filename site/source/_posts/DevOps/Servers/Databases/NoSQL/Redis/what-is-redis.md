## Description

Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker. Redis provides data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes, and streams. Redis has built-in replication, Lua scripting, LRU eviction, transactions, and different levels of on-disk persistence, and provides high availability via Redis Sentinel and automatic partitioning with Redis Cluster.

## Multi-Model Database

- Allows you to store different types of data formats in a single database.

## How Redis Works

Data Service functionality can be extended with modular plugins.

- Redis Core (key-value store, database cache)
  - RediSearch
  - RedisGraph
  - RedisJSON
  - RedisTimeSeries
