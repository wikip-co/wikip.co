## Description

Wrangler is a command-line tool for building Cloudflare Workers.[^1]

Installing Wrangler, the Workers CLI, allows you to init, dev, and publish your Workers projects.

There are many options to install wrangler. I have included a link to their official GitHub repo at the bottom of the page.[^2]
