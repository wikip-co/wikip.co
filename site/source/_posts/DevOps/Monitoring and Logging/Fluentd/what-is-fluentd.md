## Description

Fluentd is an open source data collector, which lets you unify data collection and consumption.

It is written primarily in the Ruby programming language.

Fluentd tries to structure data as JSON as much as possible. This allows Fluentd to unify all facets of processing log data: collecting, filtering, buffering, and outputting logs across multiple sources and destinations (Unified Logging Layer).[^1]
