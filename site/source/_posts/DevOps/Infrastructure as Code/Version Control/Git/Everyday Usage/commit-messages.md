## Description

Creating quality commit messages makes using and collaborating with Git a lot easier.[^1]

Your messages should start with a single line that’s no more than about 50 characters and that describes the changeset concisely, followed by a blank line, followed by a more detailed explanation.[^1]

It’s also a good idea to use the imperative present tense in these messages. In other words, use commands.

For example: Instead of “I added tests for” or “Adding tests for,” use “Add tests for.”[^1]
