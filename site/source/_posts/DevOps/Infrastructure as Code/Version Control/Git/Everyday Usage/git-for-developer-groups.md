## Git Commands

`git-clone` from the upstream to prime your local repository.

`git-pull` and `git-fetch` from "origin" to keep up-to-date with the upstream.

`git-push` to shared repository, if you adopt CVS style shared repository workflow.

`git-format-patch` to prepare e-mail submission, if you adopt Linux kernel-style public forum workflow.

`git-send-email` to send your e-mail submission without corruption by your MUA.

`git-request-pull` to create a summary of changes for your upstream to pull.
