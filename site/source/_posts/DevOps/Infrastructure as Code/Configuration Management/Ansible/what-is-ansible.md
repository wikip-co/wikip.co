## Description

Ansible is an open-source software provisioning, configuration management, and application-deployment tool enabling infrastructure as code.

It runs on many Unix-like systems, and can configure both Unix-like systems as well as Microsoft Windows.

It includes its own declarative language to describe system configuration.

Ansible is agentless, temporarily connecting remotely via SSH or Windows Remote Management (allowing remote PowerShell execution) to do its tasks.

Ansible uses a simple syntax (YAML) and simple command-line tools (using common POSIX conventions) for all its powerful abilities.
