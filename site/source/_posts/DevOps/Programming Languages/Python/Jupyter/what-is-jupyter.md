## Background

### Jupyter Notebooks[^1]

A spin-off from the iPython project, the Jupyter project allows documents containing text, code, and visualizations. These documents are powerful tools for combining running code, output, and formatted text. Jupyter enables the delivery of documentation along with the code. It has achieved widespread popularity, especially in the data science world. Here is how to install and run Jupyter notebooks:

```
$ pip install jupyter
$ jupyter notebook
```

This command opens a web browser tab showing the current working directory. From here, you can open existing notebooks in the current project or create new ones.
