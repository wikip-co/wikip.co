## Description

Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

For a brief introduction to the ideas behind the library, you can read the introductory notes or the paper. Visit the installation page to see how you can download the package and get started with it. You can browse the example gallery to see some of the things that you can do with seaborn, and then check out the tutorial or API reference to find out how.

To see the code or report a bug, please visit the GitHub repository. General support questions are most at home on stackoverflow or discourse, which have dedicated channels for seaborn.[^1]
