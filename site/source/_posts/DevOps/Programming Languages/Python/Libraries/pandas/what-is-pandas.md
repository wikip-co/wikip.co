## Description

pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language.[^1]

Pandas allows importing data from various file formates such as CSV, JSON, Parquet, SQL databases or queries, and Microsoft Excel.

Pandas allos various data manipulation operations such as merger, reshaping, selecting, as well as data cleaning, and data wrangling features.

The development of pandas introduced into Python many comparable features of working with Dataframes that were established in the R programming language.

The pandas library is built upon another library, NumPy.[^2]
