## Description

CNCF stands for the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. They are a Linux Foundation founded in 2015 to help sustain and integrate open source technologies to orchestrate "containers" as part of a microservices architecture.[^1]

One of their main goals is to help advance container technology and align the tech industry around its evolution.

The CNCF hosts critical components of the global technology infrastructure.[^2]

CNCF brings together the world's top developers, end users, and vendors.

## Background

The CNCF was announced alongside Kubernetes 1.0, an open source container cluster manager, which was contributed to the Linux Foundation by Google as a seed technology.

Founding members include Google, CoreOS, Mesosphere, Red Hat, Twitter, Huawei, Intel, Cisco, IBM, Docker, Univa, and VMware.

Today, CNCF is supported by over 450 members.

## Projects

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) is the home of many open source projects designed for running applications in the cloud and on modern infrastructure.[^3]

The first project that joined the CNCF was Kubernetes, which was donated by Google in order to attract more contributors and users.[^3]

The various projects within the CNCF have varying tiers. . . (see below)

There are also many other projects which are not part of the CNCF, but which are tracked in the CNCF cloud native interactive landscape and partitioned into various categories like networking, security, runtime and more.[^3]

### Sandbox

These are projects that are just starting, and need a lot of input and change before becoming more mature.

### Incubation

These projects are considered suitable for production, and show growing signs of traction.

### Graduated

These projects are heavily used in production, with independent maintainers from several companies and organizations.
