The Linux Foundation is dedicated to building sustainable ecosystems around open source projects to accelerate technology development and industry adoption. Founded in 2000, the Linux Foundation provides unparalleled support for open source communities through financial and intellectual resources, infrastructure, services, events, and training. Working together, the Linux Foundation and its projects form the most ambitious and successful investment in the creation of shared technology.[^1]

## Linux Foundation Umbrella

The Linux Foundation is the umbrella for many critical open source projects that power corporations today, spanning all industry sectors.[^1]

Each foundation aims to level the playing field between companies that may otherwise be competitors, and to bring various efforts together.[^1]

The two main foundations are the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and LF Edge.[^1]

LF Edge is an umbrella organization that aims to establish an open, interoperable framework for edge computing independent of hardware, silicon, cloud, or operating system. LF Edge is a Linux Foundation initiative and was launched in January of 2019; at launch, LF Edge was comprised of five projects that aimed to support emerging edge applications in the area of non-traditional video and connected things that require lower latency, faster processing and mobility. At launch, it had the support of 60 global organizations as founding members and new project contributions.[^1]

> "We are fostering collaboration and innovation across the multiple industries including industrial manufacturing, cities and government, energy, transportation, retail, home and building automation, automotive, logistics and health care â€” all of which stand to be transformed by edge computing."[^1]

The LF Edge Interactive Landscape web page provides a good representation of the organizations supporting the LF Edge initiatives.[^1]
