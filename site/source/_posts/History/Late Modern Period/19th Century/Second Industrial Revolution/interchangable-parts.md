The modern concept of interchangeable parts emerged during the 18th and early 19th centuries. The idea of implemmenting a standardized system of interchangeable manufacture was gradually developed. The development took decades and involved many people.

From the 1860s-1880s true interchangeability grew from a scarce and difficult achievement into an everyday capability throughout the manufacturing industries.
