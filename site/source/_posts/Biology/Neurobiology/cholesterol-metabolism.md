- Cholesterol is a vital component of cell membranes.[^1]
- Cholesterol is essential for the formation of specialized membrane microdomains known as lipid rafts, which are involved in cellular activities
including transduction and protein trafficking.[^1]
  - This lipid raft is a sterol-rich sphingolipid-rich domain as a host for several cell signalling processes.[^1]
- Cholesterol is very crucial for synapse activity and plasticity in the brain.[^1]
- Cholesterol influences the organization and function of neurotransmitter receptors, hence altering signal transmission between the neurons.[^1]
- Cholesterol regulates synaptic vesicle release, which is required for effective neurotransmission.[^1]
- Cholesterol contributes to the creation and stability of dendritic spines, which are tiny protrusions on neurons that are essential for synaptic connection and plasticity.[^1]

- Cholesterol is a precursor for the manufacture of neurosteroids, which are steroid hormones that affect neuronal excitability and have neuroprotective properties.[^1]
- Cholesterol-derived neurosteroids regulate synaptic activity, improve neuronal longevity, and influence cognitive performance.[^1]
- Cholesterol plays a crucial role in maintaining brain cell integrity and function.[^1]


### Dysregulation of cholesterol metabolism 

- Dysregulation of cholesterol metabolism has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD).[^1]
- Several mechanisms contribute to how cholesterol may be responsible for AD.
  - One factor is the impairment of cholesterol transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB).
    - The BBB tightly regulates the entry of cholesterol and other molecules into the brain to maintain cholesterol homeostasis.[^1]
    - AD is associated with potential compromises in the integrity and function of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), leading to perturbed cholesterol transport.
      - Specifically, changes in the expression and activity of cholesterol transporters, including ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, may disturb the balance of cholesterol influx and efflux at the BBB.
      - These alterations can lead to abnormal cholesterol levels within the brain, potentially contributing to the pathogenesis and advancement of AD.
  - Another aspect of disrupted cholesterol homeostasis in AD is the dysregulation of cholesterol biosynthesis.[^1]
    - Cholesterol biosynthesis is a tightly regulated process in healthy cells, but in AD, there is evidence of dysregulation in key enzymes involved in cholesterol production, such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR).
      - HMGCR is responsible for the production of mevalonic acid, an obligatory precursor for many sterols and non-sterols.
    - Studies have shown alterations in the expression and activity of HMGCR in the brains of individuals with AD, leading to the accumulation of cholesterol precursors and intermediates.
      - For example, an oxysterol, 24S-hydroxycholesterol is found abundantly in the brain while another metabolite, 27-hydroxycholesterol has higher concentrations in the capillary network outside the BBB.
    - These dysregulated cholesterol biosynthesis pathways may contribute to the increased cholesterol levels observed in AD.[^1]
  - There is evidence of altered cholesterol trafficking and storage within neurons and astrocytes in AD.[^1]
    - Cholesterol is transported between different cellular compartments through a complex network of proteins and lipids.[^1]
    - Changes in cholesterol transporters and regulatory proteins, such as Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) and caveolin-1, have been reported in AD.[^1]
    - These alterations can lead to impaired cholesterol transport and abnormal accumulation of cholesterol and its derivatives within intracellular compartments, including endosomes and lysosomes.[^1]
      - The accumulation of cholesterol in these compartments can contribute to cellular dysfunction and the formation of characteristic AD pathologies, such as amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.[^1]
  - The disruption of cholesterol homeostasis in AD has significant implications for disease progression.
    - Altered cholesterol metabolism can impact the processing and clearance of amyloid precursor protein (APP), leading to the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, which are the main components of amyloid plaques in AD.
    - Cholesterol dysregulation can also contribute to neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction, all of which are thought to play a role in the neurodegenerative processes observed in AD.[^1]
- The therapeutic implications of restoring cholesterol balance and preserving appropriate cho-lesterol homeostasis could be significant in impeding the progression of AD and ameliorating the accompanying cognitive decline.[^1]
