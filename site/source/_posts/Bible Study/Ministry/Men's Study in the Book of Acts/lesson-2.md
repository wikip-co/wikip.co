# Acts 4:1-4
## Question One
Peter's bold messge produced two opposite responses.  What were they?

> _1 The priests and the captain of the temple guard and the Sadducees came up to Peter and John while they were speaking to the people. 2 They were greatly disturbed because the apostles were teaching the people, proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection of the dead. 3 They seized Peter and John and, because it was evening, they put them in jail until the next day. 4 But many who heard the message believed; so the number of men who believed grew to about five thousand._

### Two Opposite Responses:

1. **Opposition and Arrest from the religious leaders:**
   - The priests, the captain of the temple guard, and the Sadducees were disturbed by Peter and John’s teaching. They were particularly unsettled because the apostles were proclaiming the resurrection of the dead in Jesus.
   - As a result of their disturbance and opposition, they seized Peter and John, putting them in jail until the next day. This action represents a rejection of the message and an attempt to suppress the spreading of the Christian faith.

2. **Belief and Growth among the people:**
   - On the other hand, many who heard Peter and John’s message believed in what they were saying. This resulted in a significant growth in the number of believers, with about five thousand men coming to believe.
   - This response represents acceptance and faith in the message of the resurrection of Jesus and indicates the message’s powerful impact on a substantial number of people.

Peter and John’s bold proclamation of the resurrection of Jesus in Acts 4 elicited two contrasting reactions: one of opposition and suppression by the religious authorities, and another of belief and spiritual growth among many listeners. This dichotomy illustrates the diverse impact of the Christian message in the early days of the apostolic ministry.

# Acts 4:5-12
## Question Two
What happened the next day?  Who did Peter and John have to face, and what were they asked?

> _5 The next day the rulers, the elders and the teachers of the law met in Jerusalem. 6 Annas the high priest was there, and so were Caiaphas, John, Alexander and others of the high priest’s family. 7 They had Peter and John brought before them and began to question them: “By what power or what name did you do this?”_

### What Happened the Next Day?

The next day, after Peter and John had been arrested, a gathering of significant figures in the Jewish religious hierarchy convened. This assembly included rulers, elders, and teachers of the law, indicating a formal and high-level meeting to address the actions and teachings of Peter and John.

### Who Did Peter and John Have to Face?

Peter and John were brought before a notable assembly which included:
- **Rulers, elders, and teachers of the law:** These were influential figures in the Jewish community, responsible for maintaining religious order and interpreting the law.
- **Annas the high priest:** A significant religious authority in Judaism during that time.
- **Caiaphas:** Also a high priest, and a powerful figure. He was the son-in-law of Annas.
- **John, Alexander, and others of the high priest’s family:** Other members of the priestly family who held positions of influence.

### What Were They Asked?

Peter and John were asked by what power or in whose name they had healed the lame man. This question aimed to understand the source of their authority and the nature of the power they had exercised in performing the miracle. The religious leaders were likely seeking to ascertain whether their actions and teachings were aligned with Jewish law and tradition or whether they were promoting beliefs considered heretical or blasphemous.

Peter and John faced a formidable assembly of religious authorities the day after their arrest. They were questioned about the source of their authority to perform miracles, reflecting the leaders’ concerns about the legitimacy and implications of their actions and teachings.

## Question Three
The gospels in the new testament describe three occasions where Peter, out of weakness and fear, willfully and publicly deny Jesus.  In this scene of Acts 4, Peter again faces threats, yet he responds differently.  What changed? And what three important things about Jesus did Peter boldly point out to the Jewish leaders?

> _5 The next day the rulers, the elders and the teachers of the law met in Jerusalem. 6 Annas the high priest was there, and so were Caiaphas, John, Alexander and others of the high priest’s family. 7 They had Peter and John brought before them and began to question them: “By what power or what name did you do this?”_
>
> _8 Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them: “Rulers and elders of the people! 9 If we are being called to account today for an act of kindness shown to a man who was lame and are being asked how he was healed, 10 then know this, you and all the people of Israel: It is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified but whom God raised from the dead, that this man stands before you healed. 11 Jesus is_

> _‘the stone you builders rejected,_
> _which has become the cornerstone.’_
>
> _12 Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved.”_

### What Changed for Peter?

Peter’s transformation from a state of denial to bold proclamation is attributed to several key factors:

- **The Holy Spirit:** After Jesus’ ascension, the Holy Spirit was poured out on the disciples during Pentecost (Acts 2). Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, spoke with newfound boldness and clarity.
- **Witnessing the Resurrected Christ:** Seeing and interacting with the resurrected Jesus strengthened the faith and conviction of the disciples, empowering them to be witnesses of His resurrection.
- **The Healing Miracle:** Peter had just been part of a significant miracle—the healing of a lame man in the name of Jesus. This miracle, and the subsequent attention it garnered, provided a platform for testimony.

### Three Important Things Peter Pointed Out:

1. **Jesus as the Healer:** Peter attributed the healing of the lame man to the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, emphasizing His power even after His earthly demise.

2. **Jesus’ Resurrection:** Peter boldly proclaimed that although the Jewish leaders had crucified Jesus, God raised Him from the dead, establishing Him as the living Savior and Lord.

3. **Jesus as the Only Savior:** Peter emphasized that salvation is found in no one else but Jesus, asserting the uniqueness of Jesus’ role in salvation, as there is "no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved."

Peter’s transformation is a testament to the transformative power of the Holy Spirit and the resurrection of Jesus Christ. His message to the Jewish leaders encapsulated the core of the Christian gospel: Jesus' divine authority, His resurrection, and His unique role in salvation.
