# Acts 4:1-4
## Question One
Peter's bold messge produced two opposite responses.  What were they?

> _1 The priests and the captain of the temple guard and the Sadducees came up to Peter and John while they were speaking to the people. 2 They were greatly disturbed because the apostles were teaching the people, proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection of the dead. 3 They seized Peter and John and, because it was evening, they put them in jail until the next day. 4 But many who heard the message believed; so the number of men who believed grew to about five thousand._

### Two Opposite Responses:

1. **Opposition and Arrest from the religious leaders:**
   - The priests, the captain of the temple guard, and the Sadducees were disturbed by Peter and John’s teaching. They were particularly unsettled because the apostles were proclaiming the resurrection of the dead in Jesus.
   - As a result of their disturbance and opposition, they seized Peter and John, putting them in jail until the next day. This action represents a rejection of the message and an attempt to suppress the spreading of the Christian faith.

2. **Belief and Growth among the people:**
   - On the other hand, many who heard Peter and John’s message believed in what they were saying. This resulted in a significant growth in the number of believers, with about five thousand men coming to believe.
   - This response represents acceptance and faith in the message of the resurrection of Jesus and indicates the message’s powerful impact on a substantial number of people.

Peter and John’s bold proclamation of the resurrection of Jesus in Acts 4 elicited two contrasting reactions: one of opposition and suppression by the religious authorities, and another of belief and spiritual growth among many listeners. This dichotomy illustrates the diverse impact of the Christian message in the early days of the apostolic ministry.

# Acts 4:5-12
## Question Two
What happened the next day?  Who did Peter and John have to face, and what were they asked?

> _5 The next day the rulers, the elders and the teachers of the law met in Jerusalem. 6 Annas the high priest was there, and so were Caiaphas, John, Alexander and others of the high priest’s family. 7 They had Peter and John brought before them and began to question them: “By what power or what name did you do this?”_

### What Happened the Next Day?

The next day, after Peter and John had been arrested, a gathering of significant figures in the Jewish religious hierarchy convened. This assembly included rulers, elders, and teachers of the law, indicating a formal and high-level meeting to address the actions and teachings of Peter and John.

### Who Did Peter and John Have to Face?

Peter and John were brought before a notable assembly which included:
- **Rulers, elders, and teachers of the law:** These were influential figures in the Jewish community, responsible for maintaining religious order and interpreting the law.
- **Annas the high priest:** A significant religious authority in Judaism during that time.
- **Caiaphas:** Also a high priest, and a powerful figure. He was the son-in-law of Annas.
- **John, Alexander, and others of the high priest’s family:** Other members of the priestly family who held positions of influence.

### What Were They Asked?

Peter and John were asked by what power or in whose name they had healed the lame man. This question aimed to understand the source of their authority and the nature of the power they had exercised in performing the miracle. The religious leaders were likely seeking to ascertain whether their actions and teachings were aligned with Jewish law and tradition or whether they were promoting beliefs considered heretical or blasphemous.

Peter and John faced a formidable assembly of religious authorities the day after their arrest. They were questioned about the source of their authority to perform miracles, reflecting the leaders’ concerns about the legitimacy and implications of their actions and teachings.

## Question Three
The gospels in the new testament describe three occasions where Peter, out of weakness and fear, willfully and publicly deny Jesus.  In this scene of Acts 4, Peter again faces threats, yet he responds differently.  What changed? And what three important things about Jesus did Peter boldly point out to the Jewish leaders?

> _5 The next day the rulers, the elders and the teachers of the law met in Jerusalem. 6 Annas the high priest was there, and so were Caiaphas, John, Alexander and others of the high priest’s family. 7 They had Peter and John brought before them and began to question them: “By what power or what name did you do this?”_
>
> _8 Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them: “Rulers and elders of the people! 9 If we are being called to account today for an act of kindness shown to a man who was lame and are being asked how he was healed, 10 then know this, you and all the people of Israel: It is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified but whom God raised from the dead, that this man stands before you healed. 11 Jesus is_

> _‘the stone you builders rejected,_
> _which has become the cornerstone.’_
>
> _12 Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved.”_

### What Changed for Peter?

Peter’s transformation from a state of denial to bold proclamation is attributed to several key factors:

- **The Holy Spirit:** After Jesus’ ascension, the Holy Spirit was poured out on the disciples during Pentecost (Acts 2). Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, spoke with newfound boldness and clarity.
- **Witnessing the Resurrected Christ:** Seeing and interacting with the resurrected Jesus strengthened the faith and conviction of the disciples, empowering them to be witnesses of His resurrection.
- **The Healing Miracle:** Peter had just been part of a significant miracle—the healing of a lame man in the name of Jesus. This miracle, and the subsequent attention it garnered, provided a platform for testimony.

### Three Important Things Peter Pointed Out:

1. **Jesus as the Healer:** Peter attributed the healing of the lame man to the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, emphasizing His power even after His earthly demise.

2. **Jesus’ Resurrection:** Peter boldly proclaimed that although the Jewish leaders had crucified Jesus, God raised Him from the dead, establishing Him as the living Savior and Lord.

3. **Jesus as the Only Savior:** Peter emphasized that salvation is found in no one else but Jesus, asserting the uniqueness of Jesus’ role in salvation, as there is "no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved."

Peter’s transformation is a testament to the transformative power of the Holy Spirit and the resurrection of Jesus Christ. His message to the Jewish leaders encapsulated the core of the Christian gospel: Jesus' divine authority, His resurrection, and His unique role in salvation.

# Acts 4:13-22
## Question Four
What did the religious leaders notice about Peter and John (v13)?

> _13 When they saw the courage of Peter and John and realized that they were unschooled, ordinary men, they were astonished and they took note that these men had been with Jesus._

### What the Religious Leaders Noticed:

1. **Courage and Boldness:**
   - The religious leaders observed that Peter and John spoke with courage and boldness. Despite facing a formidable assembly of religious authorities, they didn’t back down or show signs of intimidation or fear.

2. **Lack of Formal Education:**
   - They noticed that Peter and John were "unschooled, ordinary men," meaning that they didn’t have formal religious education or Rabbinic training. This was surprising to the religious leaders, given the confidence and authority with which Peter and John spoke.

3. **Association with Jesus:**
   - The religious leaders recognized that Peter and John had been with Jesus. This association helped them understand the source of Peter and John’s boldness and authority, as their demeanor and message were consistent with the teachings and manner of Jesus.

The religious leaders were astonished by the boldness and confidence of Peter and John, especially considering their lack of formal religious education. The leaders realized that their association with Jesus was a significant factor in their demeanor and message, reflecting the impact of Jesus’ teachings and presence on his followers.

## Question Four A
We cannot spend time with Jesus physically as the disciples did, but we can defintely spend time with Jesus by studying His Word.  As we spend time with Jesus, we also grow in wisdom, discernment, leadership, personal character, integrity, and our boldness to testify of Him.  Without ever realizing it, the disciples had grown tremendously, and this was evident to all.  Do others recognize you as having spent time with Jesus? Or do you simply blend in like everyone else?

A core aspect of Christian spiritual life is the transformative impact of spending time with Jesus through prayer, worship, and studying His Word.

### Spending Time with Jesus Today:

- **Studying the Word:** Engaging deeply with the Scriptures allows us to know Jesus better, understand His teachings, and apply them in our lives.
- **Prayer:** Through prayer, we can have a personal conversation with God, expressing our thoughts, feelings, and desires, and listening to His guidance.
- **Worship:** Participating in worship, whether individually or collectively, allows us to express our love, reverence, and gratitude to God.

### Transformation and Growth:

- **Wisdom and Discernment:** Spending time with Jesus helps us gain wisdom and discernment, enabling us to make choices that align with God’s will.
- **Character and Integrity:** Our character is molded as we internalize Christ’s teachings and seek to live according to His example.
- **Boldness in Testimony:** As our relationship with Jesus strengthens, our confidence to share His love and truth with others increases.

### Recognition by Others:

- **Witnessing Our Faith:** Others may notice a difference in our attitudes, behaviors, and priorities as a result of our relationship with Jesus.
- **Influence:** Our growth and transformation can influence others positively, leading them towards a relationship with Jesus.

### Reflection:

- **Self-Examination:** It’s beneficial to regularly examine whether our lives reflect Christ’s influence and whether we are lights in the world.
- **Intentionality:** Being intentional about spending time with Jesus and seeking transformation ensures that our faith remains vibrant and influential.

Our spiritual growth and transformation become evident to others as we consistently spend time with Jesus and allow His teachings and presence to shape our lives. This influence can be a powerful testimony, drawing others towards the love and truth found in Christ. Being mindful of our spiritual journey's outward reflection encourages us to pursue a genuine and transformative relationship with Jesus.

When you ask, "Or do you simply blend in like everyone else?" you are raising a question about the visibility and distinctiveness of one's Christian faith in their daily life and interactions. It points towards the following considerations:

### 1. **Visibility of Faith:**
   - **Does your faith manifest in your actions and decisions?** The question invites reflection on whether one's faith is evident through their behavior, choices, and way of interacting with others.

### 2. **Distinctiveness:**
   - **Is there something different in your demeanor or lifestyle that reflects Christian values?** It challenges one to consider whether their faith makes them stand out in some way, showcasing the transformative power of the Gospel.

### 3. **Influence and Testimony:**
   - **Does your life bear witness to your faith in Christ?** The question encourages evaluating whether one's life serves as a testimony, influencing others positively towards Christ.

### 4. **Integration with the World:**
   - **Are Christian principles integrated into every aspect of life, or is faith compartmentalized?** It encourages reflection on whether faith is a pervasive influence or limited to certain aspects of life.

### 5. **Authenticity:**
   - **Is the faith professed aligned with the life lived?** This question underscores the importance of authenticity and consistency in one’s faith journey.

The question "Or do you simply blend in like everyone else?" is an invitation to reflect on the lived expression of one’s faith. It encourages individuals to consider whether their relationship with Christ is vibrant and transformative, making a noticeable impact on their lives, or whether it's indistinct and submerged within societal norms and expectations. It emphasizes the aspirational aspect of Christian living — to be a light in the world, embodying and sharing the love and truth of Christ.
