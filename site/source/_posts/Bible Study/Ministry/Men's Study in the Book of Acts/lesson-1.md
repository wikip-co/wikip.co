## Acts 1:11

This passage sets the stage for the events that follow in the Book of Acts, laying the groundwork for the continuation of Jesus' ministry through the apostles and the coming of the Holy Spirit.

### Text

```
1 In the first book, O Theophilus, I have dealt with all that Jesus began to do and teach,
2 until the day when he was taken up, after he had given commands through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen.
3 He presented himself alive to them after his suffering by many proofs, appearing to them during forty days and speaking about the kingdom of God.
4 And while staying with them he ordered them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, he said, "you heard from me;
5 for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now."
6 So when they had come together, they asked him, "Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?"
7 He said to them, "It is not for you to know times or seasons that the Father has fixed by his own authority.
8 But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth."
9 And when he had said these things, as they were looking on, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight.
10 And while they were gazing into heaven as he went, behold, two men stood by them in white robes,
11 and said, "Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into heaven? This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven."
```

### Names Mentioned

1. **Theophilus**: In Acts 1:1, Luke addresses "Theophilus," the same individual to whom the Gospel of Luke is also addressed. The name Theophilus means "Friend of God" or "Loved by God" in Greek. It is not entirely clear whether this was a specific individual or a generic term for believers.

2. **Jesus**: The central figure, whose teachings and actions are the focus of both the Gospel of Luke and the Book of Acts. Jesus is mentioned as having been taken up to heaven after giving commands through the Holy Spirit to the apostles.

3. **Holy Spirit**: Mentioned as the means through which Jesus gave commands to the apostles. The Holy Spirit is promised to come upon the apostles to empower them.

4. **Apostles**: While the term "apostles" is mentioned, specific names are not given in these verses. However, they are understood to be the close followers of Jesus who were chosen by Him.

5. **John**: Mentioned in Acts 1:5 in the context of "John's baptism," referring to John the Baptist, who baptized people with water.

6. **Men of Galilee**: This term is used in Acts 1:11 to address the apostles and disciples who were watching Jesus ascend. It is not a specific name but rather a description of the group of followers who were from Galilee.

### 1.)

The word "began" in the opening lines of the Book of Acts ("the former account I made") suggests that what was described in the Gospel of Luke was only the beginning of the work of Jesus. The implication is that Jesus' work continues even after His ascension to heaven. This notion paves the way for the Book of Acts to describe how the mission and message of Jesus are carried on by His apostles and early followers.

#### a.)

1. **Through the Holy Spirit**: One of the most significant ways Jesus' work continues is through the Holy Spirit. In the Book of Acts, the Holy Spirit comes upon the apostles at Pentecost, empowering them to preach, perform miracles, and spread the Gospel. The Holy Spirit serves as a guide, comforter, and empowerer for believers.

2. **Apostolic Ministry**: The apostles, most notably Peter and Paul, play pivotal roles in the early Church. They preach, heal, and perform other miracles in Jesus' name, effectively continuing His work on Earth.

3. **Community of Believers**: Acts describes how the early Church organized itself, took care of the needy, and provided a communal way of life that exemplified Jesus' teachings.

4. **Spreading the Gospel**: The apostles and other followers of Jesus undertake missionary journeys to spread the Gospel to various parts of the world, effectively enlarging the scope of Jesus' ministry.

5. **Scripture and Doctrine**: The apostles and other early Christian leaders also contribute to what would become the New Testament, providing a lasting written record that continues Jesus' work by offering teachings, guidance, and inspiration.

6. **Leadership Structures**: The early Church develops leadership structures like elders and deacons, guided by the Holy Spirit, to manage growing congregations, thereby institutionalizing the continuation of Jesus' work.

#### b.)

1. **The Apostles**: Peter takes a leadership role, especially in the early chapters of Acts. Paul becomes a dominant figure later on, especially in missionary work.

2. **Early Church Leaders**: Individuals like Stephen, Barnabas, and Timothy play significant roles.

3. **General Believers**: Ordinary men and women also contribute by living out their faith in community, sharing their resources, and spreading the word about Jesus.

4. **Holy Spirit**: Above all, it is through the Holy Spirit that Jesus' work continues. The Holy Spirit equips believers with gifts, wisdom, and power to carry on Jesus' mission.

In summary, the word "began" in the Book of Acts indicates that the work of Jesus was not completed with His ascension but rather continues in various ways and through various people, primarily powered by the Holy Spirit.

### 2.)

#### a.)

The passages in Acts 1:1-11 provides a brief summary of Jesus' post-resurrection appearances and teachings, His ascension into heaven, and the promise of His return.

From this passage, there are several words and phrases that Luke uses to emphasize the reality of Jesus' resurrection and ascension:

1. **"He presented himself alive"** (v. 3): Luke emphasizes the fact that Jesus appeared alive after His death and resurrection.
 
2. **"by many proofs"** (v. 3): This phrase suggests that Jesus' post-resurrection appearances were not isolated or ambiguous events, but were clear and convincing evidences of His resurrection.

3. **"appearing to them during forty days"** (v. 3): The duration of Jesus' post-resurrection appearances further establishes the reality of His resurrection. It wasn't a fleeting moment, but a period spanning over a month.

4. **"he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight"** (v. 9): This describes the visible ascension of Jesus into heaven, witnessed by the apostles.

5. **"while they were gazing into heaven as he went"** (v. 10): The apostles' persistent gaze underscores the astonishing nature of the event they just witnessed.

6. **"This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven"** (v. 11): The angels' proclamation not only affirms the reality of Jesus' ascension but also the promise of His future return.

These words and phrases, when taken together, create a compelling narrative that stresses the bodily resurrection and ascension of Jesus. Luke is deliberate in presenting these events as historical realities witnessed by the apostles and other believers.

#### b.)

I am unwaveringly confident in the bodily resurrection of Jesus Christ. While aspects of His life, like leading a perfect existence, sometimes mystify me, my study of His accounts consistently reaffirms my belief. Through His teachings, interactions, and the wisdom He emparted, it becomes clear to me that He is the physical embodiment of Jehovah, our Heavenly Father. Even though I may not fully understand the intricacies of the Trinity, the core of my belief remains: Jesus was resurrected. This conviction is rooted in my trust in His purpose and promise. His willingness to sacrifice Himself, bear the wrath of God for our sins, and His passion for reconciling humanity with God all point towards His triumphant resurrection and ascension.

### 3.)

Several purposes of the forty days can be discerned:

1. **To Provide Proof of His Resurrection**: Verse 3 mentions that Jesus "presented himself alive to them after his suffering by many proofs." This indicates that one of the main purposes of the forty days was to offer undeniable evidence to His disciples that He had indeed risen from the dead.

2. **To Teach About the Kingdom of God**: The same verse also states that Jesus spent the time "speaking about the kingdom of God." This suggests that Jesus was using this period to further instruct His disciples on the nature, values, and principles of God's kingdom.

3. **To Give Commands**: Verse 2 tells us that Jesus "had given commands through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen." This means that Jesus was guiding them on what they should do next and how they should carry out their mission.

4. **To Prepare Them for the Coming of the Holy Spirit**: In verses 4 and 5, Jesus instructs His disciples to stay in Jerusalem and wait for "the promise of the Father." He then explains that while John baptized with water, they would be baptized with the Holy Spirit in a few days. This shows that Jesus was preparing them for the empowerment they would receive from the Holy Spirit, an event that takes place in Acts 2 with the coming of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost.

In summary, the forty days Jesus spent with His disciples after His resurrection served to provide undeniable proof of His resurrection, to instruct them further on the kingdom of God, to give them commands for their mission, and to prepare them for the baptism and empowerment of the Holy Spirit.

### 4.)

#### a.)

The specific command Jesus gave to His disciples was to **not depart from Jerusalem** but to **wait for the promise of the Father**.

> Acts 1:4 (ESV):
> "And while staying with them he ordered them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, he said, 'you heard from me;'"

> Luke 24:49 (ESV):
> "And behold, I am sending the promise of my Father upon you. But stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high."

#### b.)

The reason this command was critical:

1. **Empowerment for Ministry**: The "promise of the Father" refers to the coming of the Holy Spirit. In the very next chapter of Acts (Acts 2), the Holy Spirit descends on the disciples during the day of Pentecost. This event empowers the disciples for their ministry, granting them the ability to speak in various tongues and boldly proclaim the gospel. Without this empowerment, the early spread of the Christian message would have faced significantly more challenges.

2. **Fulfillment of Prophecy**: By waiting for the Holy Spirit in Jerusalem, the disciples were in the right place to witness the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and Jesus' own promises about the coming of the Spirit.

3. **Foundation for the Church**: The coming of the Holy Spirit on Pentecost is considered the "birthday" of the Christian Church. Jesus knew that the disciples needed the Holy Spirit's empowerment to be effective witnesses and to establish the Church. By staying in Jerusalem and receiving the Holy Spirit, they were equipped to begin this monumental task.

In essence, the command to wait in Jerusalem was critical because it prepared the disciples for the essential empowerment of the Holy Spirit, setting the stage for the rapid spread of the gospel and the establishment of the early Christian Church.

### 5.)

**Acts 1:6-8 (ESV):**
```
6. So when they had come together, they asked him, "Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?"
7. He said to them, "It is not for you to know times or seasons that the Father has fixed by his own authority.
8. But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth."
```

**Summary:**

The disciples ask Jesus if He is going to restore the kingdom to Israel at that time. Jesus responds by telling them that the timing of such events is determined by the Father and is not for them to know. Instead of focusing on when the kingdom will be restored, they should anticipate the coming of the Holy Spirit, who will empower them. Once empowered, they are to be witnesses for Jesus, starting in Jerusalem and eventually spreading the message to the ends of the earth.

**What stands out:**

1. **The Disciples' Expectation**: The disciples still have a somewhat earthly or political expectation about the Messiah's role, thinking in terms of a restored national kingdom for Israel. This reflects a common Jewish expectation of the time.
 
2. **Jesus' Refocus**: Instead of providing a direct answer about the timing of the kingdom's restoration, Jesus redirects their attention to their immediate mission. This emphasizes the importance of the task at hand over speculative future events.

3. **The Universal Scope of the Mission**: Jesus doesn't limit their mission to just the Jewish people or Israel. He expands it to "the end of the earth." This foreshadows the global scope of the Christian mission and the inclusion of Gentiles in the Church.

4. **The Role of the Holy Spirit**: Jesus emphasizes the critical role of the Holy Spirit in their mission. It's not by their own strength or understanding that they'll succeed, but by the power and guidance of the Holy Spirit.

The conversation underscores the shift from earthly and nationalistic expectations to a spiritual and global mission, empowered by the Holy Spirit.

### 6.)

**Acts 1:8 (ESV):**
"But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth."

**Matthew 28:18-20 (ESV):**
"18. And Jesus came and said to them, 'All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. 
19. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 
20. teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.'"

#### a.)

Yes, these verses apply to me and all Christians. While Jesus originally spoke these words to His immediate disciples, the command has traditionally been understood by the church as an ongoing mandate for all believers throughout history. The "Great Commission" is a foundational aspect of Christian teaching and mission, emphasizing the spread of the Gospel and the making of disciples.

#### b.)

1. **Be Empowered by the Holy Spirit**: Before embarking on the mission, believers are to be empowered by the Holy Spirit. This suggests that the work of evangelism and discipleship is not merely a human effort but is carried out in the power and guidance of the Holy Spirit.

2. **Witness and Evangelize**: Christians are called to be witnesses of Jesus, sharing the Gospel message. This involves proclaiming the good news of Christ's death and resurrection for the forgiveness of sins and the hope of eternal life.

3. **Make Disciples**: Beyond just sharing the Gospel, there's an emphasis on making disciples. This involves not only leading people to faith in Christ but also helping them grow in their understanding and obedience to His teachings.

4. **Baptize**: Baptism is highlighted as an integral step in the discipleship process, symbolizing a believer's identification with Jesus in His death, burial, and resurrection.

5. **Teach**: New disciples are to be taught to observe all that Jesus commanded. This emphasizes the importance of ongoing spiritual education and growth in the Christian life.

6. **Think Globally**: The command is to reach "all nations" and "to the end of the earth." This means that the Gospel message is universal, applicable to every culture and people group.

7. **Remember Jesus' Presence**: Jesus promises His continual presence with His followers. This is a source of comfort and assurance, knowing that in fulfilling this commission, believers are not alone.

In summary, as a Christian, these verses call you to be an active participant in the mission of the church, sharing the Gospel, making disciples, baptizing, and teaching, all while relying on the empowerment and presence of the Holy Spirit and Jesus Himself.

#### c.)

The word "dynamis" in Acts 1:8, refers to ability, power, might, strength, or capability. It is the root word from which we get terms like "dynamic" and "dynamite." In the context of Acts 1:8, it signifies the supernatural empowerment that the Holy Spirit provides.

**Similarities between our situation and that of the early church:**

1. **Reliance on the Holy Spirit**: Just as the early disciples needed the Holy Spirit's power to be effective witnesses, you, as a modern-day Christian, also need the same empowerment. Human effort alone is insufficient for spiritual work. The challenges of sharing the Gospel, enduring persecution, or even just living a Christian life in daily situations require a strength that goes beyond human capability.

2. **The Universal Mission**: The command to be witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and to the ends of the earth is as applicable today as it was in the early church. While the geographical context might differ, the mandate to reach both local communities and distant nations remains.

3. **Facing Opposition**: The early church faced significant opposition, from both religious leaders and Roman authorities. Today's Christians, depending on their location and cultural context, might also face challenges, misunderstandings, or even direct persecution for their faith.

4. **Living in a Post-Resurrection Reality**: Just as the early disciples lived in the light of Jesus' resurrection, so do you. The resurrection is the foundation of Christian hope and is central to the message shared with others.

5. **The Role of Community**: The early church wasn't just individual disciples doing individual tasks; they operated as a community, supporting and encouraging each other. Similarly, modern Christians are often most effective when working within a community of believers, be it a local church, small group, or other Christian fellowship.

6. **The Continual Presence of Jesus**: Jesus' promise, "I am with you always, to the end of the age" (Matthew 28:20), remains true for you just as it was for the early disciples. This assurance is foundational for any Christian endeavor.

In essence, while the cultural, historical, and societal contexts might differ, the foundational aspects of the Christian mission remain consistent. The need for the Holy Spirit's empowerment, the call to be witnesses, the challenges faced, and the assurance of Jesus' presence are all constants that bridge the gap between the early church and today's believers.

### 7.)

#### a.)

In Acts 1:9-11, two significant miraculous events transpired immediately after Jesus finished speaking:

**Acts 1:9-11 (ESV):**
```
9. And when he had said these things, as they were looking on, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight.
10. And while they were gazing into heaven as he went, behold, two men stood by them in white robes,
11. and said, "Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into heaven? This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven."
```

**Miraculous Events:**
1. **Jesus' Ascension**: As the disciples watched, Jesus was "lifted up" and then obscured by a cloud as He ascended into heaven. This marked His physical departure from the earth and His return to the Father.
2. **Appearance of Two Men in White Robes**: While the disciples were still looking up after Jesus' ascension, two men in white robes (often understood to be angels) appeared beside them. These angels delivered a message to the disciples about Jesus' eventual return.

**What might have been going through the disciples' minds:**
1. **Awe and Wonder**: The disciples had just witnessed the physical ascension of Jesus into heaven, a sight that would undoubtedly fill them with amazement.
2. **Confusion or Disorientation**: The sudden departure of Jesus, especially after His recent resurrection and the forty days spent with them, might have left the disciples disoriented or uncertain about what was to happen next.
3. **Anticipation**: The message from the angels emphasized that Jesus would return in the same manner as He ascended. This promise could have instilled a sense of hope and anticipation in the disciples.
4. **A Sense of Urgency**: With the recent instructions from Jesus about being witnesses and the coming of the Holy Spirit, coupled with His ascension and the angelic message, the disciples might have felt an increased sense of urgency or purpose regarding their mission.
5. **Reflection**: They might have been reflecting on Jesus' teachings, promises, and the significance of all the events they had witnessed, from His ministry to His death, resurrection, and now His ascension.

In essence, the disciples likely experienced a whirlwind of emotions and thoughts as they tried to process the profound spiritual significance of these miraculous events and what they meant for their future mission.

#### b.)

The specific message given by the two angels (or "two men in white robes") is found in Acts 1:11:

**Acts 1:11 (ESV):**
```
"Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into heaven? This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven."
```

**Specific Message:**
The angels addressed the disciples, emphasizing that just as they had witnessed Jesus ascending into heaven, there will come a time when Jesus will return in a similar manner. This statement is a direct affirmation of the Second Coming of Christ.

**Significant Impact on Your Life:**
1. **Hope and Anticipation**: The promise of Jesus' return provides a source of hope and anticipation for believers. It assures Christians that history is moving towards a divine culmination, where Jesus will return to establish His kingdom fully.
  
2. **Urgency in Mission**: Knowing that Jesus will return should instill an urgency in the hearts of believers to share the Gospel and fulfill the Great Commission. Time on earth is limited, and the promise of His return is a reminder to make the most of the opportunities to spread the message of Christ.
  
3. **Living Righteously**: The knowledge that Jesus will return encourages believers to live righteously and faithfully, knowing that they will one day give an account of their lives to Him. It's a motivation to persevere in faith and holiness.
  
4. **Comfort in Trials**: For believers going through hardships, persecutions, or challenging times, the promise of Jesus' return offers comfort. It's a reminder that present sufferings are temporary, and a time of restoration and redemption is coming.
  
5. **Anchor in Uncertain Times**: The world can often seem chaotic and unpredictable. The promise of Christ's return serves as an anchor, assuring believers that God is in control and has a plan that will culminate in Jesus' triumphant return.

In essence, the angels' proclamation about Jesus' return should deeply influence a believer's perspective on life, purpose, priorities, and daily living. It's a profound truth that carries implications for how one navigates both the joys and challenges of life.
