## Acts 1:11

This passage sets the stage for the events that follow in the Book of Acts, laying the groundwork for the continuation of Jesus' ministry through the apostles and the coming of the Holy Spirit.

### Names Mentioned

1. **Theophilus**: In Acts 1:1, Luke addresses "Theophilus," the same individual to whom the Gospel of Luke is also addressed. The name Theophilus means "Friend of God" or "Loved by God" in Greek. It is not entirely clear whether this was a specific individual or a generic term for believers.

2. **Jesus**: The central figure, whose teachings and actions are the focus of both the Gospel of Luke and the Book of Acts. Jesus is mentioned as having been taken up to heaven after giving commands through the Holy Spirit to the apostles.

3. **Holy Spirit**: Mentioned as the means through which Jesus gave commands to the apostles. The Holy Spirit is promised to come upon the apostles to empower them.

4. **Apostles**: While the term "apostles" is mentioned, specific names are not given in these verses. However, they are understood to be the close followers of Jesus who were chosen by Him.

5. **John**: Mentioned in Acts 1:5 in the context of "John's baptism," referring to John the Baptist, who baptized people with water.

6. **Men of Galilee**: This term is used in Acts 1:11 to address the apostles and disciples who were watching Jesus ascend. It is not a specific name but rather a description of the group of followers who were from Galilee.

### Answer to Question One 

The word "began" in the opening lines of the Book of Acts ("the former account I made") suggests that what was described in the Gospel of Luke was only the beginning of the work of Jesus. The implication is that Jesus' work continues even after His ascension to heaven. This notion paves the way for the Book of Acts to describe how the mission and message of Jesus are carried on by His apostles and early followers.

### How Does the Work of Jesus Continue After His Ascension?

1. **Through the Holy Spirit**: One of the most significant ways Jesus' work continues is through the Holy Spirit. In the Book of Acts, the Holy Spirit comes upon the apostles at Pentecost, empowering them to preach, perform miracles, and spread the Gospel. The Holy Spirit serves as a guide, comforter, and empowerer for believers.

2. **Apostolic Ministry**: The apostles, most notably Peter and Paul, play pivotal roles in the early Church. They preach, heal, and perform other miracles in Jesus' name, effectively continuing His work on Earth.

3. **Community of Believers**: Acts describes how the early Church organized itself, took care of the needy, and provided a communal way of life that exemplified Jesus' teachings.

4. **Spreading the Gospel**: The apostles and other followers of Jesus undertake missionary journeys to spread the Gospel to various parts of the world, effectively enlarging the scope of Jesus' ministry.

5. **Scripture and Doctrine**: The apostles and other early Christian leaders also contribute to what would become the New Testament, providing a lasting written record that continues Jesus' work by offering teachings, guidance, and inspiration.

6. **Leadership Structures**: The early Church develops leadership structures like elders and deacons, guided by the Holy Spirit, to manage growing congregations, thereby institutionalizing the continuation of Jesus' work.

### By Whom?

1. **The Apostles**: Peter takes a leadership role, especially in the early chapters of Acts. Paul becomes a dominant figure later on, especially in missionary work.

2. **Early Church Leaders**: Individuals like Stephen, Barnabas, and Timothy play significant roles.

3. **General Believers**: Ordinary men and women also contribute by living out their faith in community, sharing their resources, and spreading the word about Jesus.

4. **Holy Spirit**: Above all, it is through the Holy Spirit that Jesus' work continues. The Holy Spirit equips believers with gifts, wisdom, and power to carry on Jesus' mission.

In summary, the word "began" in the Book of Acts indicates that the work of Jesus was not completed with His ascension but rather continues in various ways and through various people, primarily powered by the Holy Spirit.
