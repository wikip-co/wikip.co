## Description

Kushaiah (aka Kishi) is a figure in the Old Testament. 1 Chronicles 6:44 states Kishi is a Merarite, and the father of the ancestor of Ethan the minstrel.

### Background

The name Kushaiah occurs only once in the Bible. He is the father of Ethan, whom the Levites selected from among the descendants of Merari to join a chorus of loud music makers that would liven up king David's bringing to Jerusalem of the Ark of the Covenant (1 Chronicles 15:17).[^1]

This Kushaiah is likely the same as the Kishi mentioned in 1 Chronicles 6:44, who also descended from Merari and who also had a son named Ethan. The name Kishi is the truncated form of Kushaiah.[^1]

>Note that the name is actually spelled Kushaiahu, with a final waw. Many names that end with יה also exist with the ending יהו, and traditionally translators have chosen to transliterate all these names with no u-sound at the end of it. Even though of the name Kushaiah(u) only the longer version remains, its transliteration follows the preferred shorter form.[^1]
