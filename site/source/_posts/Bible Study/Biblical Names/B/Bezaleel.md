## Background

In Exodus 31:1-6 and chapters 36 to 39, Bezaleel was the chief artisan of the Tabernacle and was in charge of building the Ark of the Covenant, assisted by Oholiab. Elsewhere in the Bible the name occurs only in the genealogical lists of the Book of Chronicles.

Bezalel is described in the genealogical lists as the son of Uri (Exodus 31:1), the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah (I Chronicles 2:18, 19, 20, 50). He was said to be highly gifted as a craftsman, showing great skill and originality in engraving precious metals and stones and in wood-carving. He was also a master-craftsman, having many apprentices under him whom he instructed in the arts (Exodus 35:30–35).

He was also in charge of the holy oils, incense, and priestly vestments. Caleb was his great-grandfather.
