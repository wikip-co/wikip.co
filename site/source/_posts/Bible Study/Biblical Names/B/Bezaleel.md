## Background

In the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament), Bezalel is a skilled artisan chosen by God to construct the Tabernacle and its various components, including the Ark of the Covenant. He is mentioned primarily in the book of Exodus, specifically in chapters 31, 35, and 36.

### Key Points about Bezalel:

1. **Divine Appointment**: God specifically names Bezalel as the one who would lead the construction of the Tabernacle (Exodus 31:1-5).

2. **Lineage**: Bezalel was a member of the tribe of Judah, the son of Uri and the grandson of Hur (Exodus 31:2).

3. **Skilled Artisan**: He was described as being filled "with the Spirit of God, with wisdom, with understanding, with knowledge and with all kinds of skills" (Exodus 31:3, NIV).

4. **Range of Skills**: Bezalel was proficient in working with a variety of materials—gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood—and was skilled in engraving and designing (Exodus 31:3-5).

5. **Assistant**: His chief assistant was Oholiab, from the tribe of Dan, who was also endowed with wisdom and skills (Exodus 31:6).

6. **The Ark of the Covenant**: One of the most significant items Bezalel created was the Ark of the Covenant, which was to house the stone tablets of the Ten Commandments.

7. **The Tabernacle**: Beyond the Ark, Bezalel was also responsible for the construction of the Tabernacle itself, including the altars, the table for the showbread, the lampstand, and the other sacred articles used in worship (Exodus 35:30-36:7).

8. **Community Involvement**: While Bezalel and Oholiab were the lead artisans, they worked with other skilled workers. The Israelite community contributed both materials and labor to the project (Exodus 35:21-29).

9. **Faithfulness**: There's no record of Bezalel failing in his duties; he carried out God’s plans as they were communicated to him through Moses.

10. **Legacy**: Bezalel’s work served as a focal point for Israelite worship until the construction of the First Temple in Jerusalem by King Solomon. His name has also become synonymous with artistic and craftsmanship excellence in Jewish tradition.

Bezalel is remembered not just for his craftsmanship but also for his role in creating a space for the divine presence to dwell among the Israelites during their journey in the wilderness. In Jewish tradition, he is often cited as a model of the kind of skill and wisdom that comes from being filled with the Spirit of God.
