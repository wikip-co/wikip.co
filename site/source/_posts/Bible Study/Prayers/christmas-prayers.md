## Verses

### Isaiah 9:6-7

```
	For unto us a Child is born,
	Unto us a Son is given;
	And the government will be upon His shoulder.
	And His name will be called
	Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God,
	Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
	Of the increase of His government and peace
	There will be no end,
	Upon the throne of David and over His kingdom,
	To order it and establish it with judgment and justice
	From that time forward, even forever.
	The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this.
```

### Galatians 4:4-5

```
	But when the fullness of the time had come, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption as sons.
```

### Matthew 1:18-25

```
	Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows: After His mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Spirit. Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not wanting to make her a public example, was minded to put her away secretly. But while he thought about these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take to you Mary your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit. And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins.”

	So all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying: “Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and bear a Son, and they shall call His name Immanuel,” which is translated, “God with us.”

	Then Joseph, being aroused from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took to him his wife, and did not know her till she had brought forth her firstborn Son. And he called His name Jesus.
```

### Luke 2:6-14

```
	So it was, that while they were there, the days were completed for her to be delivered. And she brought forth her firstborn Son, and wrapped Him in swaddling cloths, and laid Him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.

	Now there were in the same country shepherds living out in the fields, keeping watch over their flock by night. And behold, an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were greatly afraid. Then the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which will be to all people. For there is born to you this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. And this will be the sign to you: You will find a Babe wrapped in swaddling cloths, lying in a manger.”

	And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying:

	“Glory to God in the highest,
	And on earth peace, goodwill toward men!”
```

### Acts 4:10-12

```
	let it be known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, by Him this man stands here before you whole. This is the ‘stone which was rejected by you builders, which has become the chief cornerstone.’ Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.”
```
	
### Acts 10:43

```
	"To Him all the prophets witness that, through His name, whoever believes in Him will receive remission of sins.”
```

### Philippians 2:6-11

```
	who, being in the form of God, did not consider it robbery to be equal with God, but made Himself of no reputation, taking the form of a bondservant, and coming in the likeness of men. And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient to the point of death, even the death of the cross. Therefore God also has highly exalted Him and given Him the name which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, and of those on earth, and of those under the earth, and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
```

## The Essential Doctrine of Jesus' Virgin Birth

### Jesus is Fully God

- We know that Jesus is Fully God. Not part God, not semi-devine, not a demigod, not a God created... He is fully God, which means He's always been, He is, and He evermore will be.
- He is the 2nd person of the trinity.  Through Him, John would say, "The world was created and nothing was created without Him."
- He was conceived by The Holy Spirit. Therefore He is fully God, and not part God.

### Jesus is Fully Human

- He comes from the seed of a woman. Through Mary, with an ancestry all the way back to Eve.
- Because His earthly father did not have a part in the conception, Jesus is born without a Sin nature (which we inherit from Adam).  Instead the conception is done by The Holy Spirit, which makes Jesus both fully God and fully human, but without sin.
- This is essential to qualifying Him for being our savior, to fulfill the requirements of who could pay the penalty for our sin.

### The Virgin Birth is Prophetic (Fulfilled Prophecy).
#### Isaiah 7:14

```
Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel.
```

#### Genesis 3

The Protevangelium ("first gospel proclamation") is seen as a prophecy of the coming of the Messiah and the ultimate victory of Christ over Satan.
```
So the Lord God said to the serpent:

	“Because you have done this,
	You are cursed more than all cattle,
	And more than every beast of the field;
	On your belly you shall go,
	And you shall eat dust
	All the days of your life.
	And I will put enmity
	Between you and the woman,
	And between your seed and her Seed;
	He shall bruise your head,
	And you shall bruise His heel.”
```

#### Genesis 12
Promises to Abram
```
Now the Lord had said to Abram:

	“Get out of your country,
	From your family
	And from your father’s house,
	To a land that I will show you.
	I will make you a great nation;
	I will bless you
	And make your name great;
	And you shall be a blessing.
	I will bless those who bless you,
	And I will curse him who curses you;
	And in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed.”
```
#### Genesis 15
God’s Covenant with Abram
```
Then He brought him outside and said, “Look now toward heaven, and count the stars if you are able to number them.” And He said to him, “So shall your descendants be.”

	And he believed in the Lord, and He accounted it to him for righteousness.

	Then He said to him, “I am the Lord, who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give you this land to inherit it.”

	...the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying:

	“To your descendants I have given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the River Euphrates— the Kenites, the Kenezzites, the Kadmonites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.”
```

#### 2 Samuel 7
God’s Covenant with David
```
“When your days are fulfilled and you rest with your fathers, I will set up your seed after you, who will come from your body, and I will establish his kingdom. He shall build a house for My name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. I will be his Father, and he shall be My son. If he commits iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men and with the blows of the sons of men. But My mercy shall not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I removed from before you. And your house and your kingdom shall be established forever before you. Your throne shall be established forever.” ’ ”
```
### Qualified as our Kinsman Redeemer

A kinsman redeemer is a relative who, at his own expense, pays off the debts of another. But this theme points beyond finances, because our greatest need is not for someone to pay off financial debts—however great that need might be—but for someone to redeem us from the debt our sins have incurred.

- He is our relative who can provide for and protect us by laying down His own life and covering our sin.
- Jesus is the fulfillment of the Kinsman Redeemer
  
#### Hebrews 2:11
```
"For both He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of one, for which reason He is not ashamed to call them brethren,"
```
