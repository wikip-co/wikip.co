- The earliest surviving manuscripts of Acts are part of larger collections of New Testament texts. The Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus, dating from the 4th century AD, are among the most important.

- Texts included in the New Testament canon had to be apostolic in origin, widely accepted by the Church, and consistent with accepted doctrine. Acts met these criteria as an account of apostolic actions and teachings.
- By the end of the 4th century, the canon of the New Testament was largely settled in both the Eastern and Western Church, with Acts universally accepted as a part of it.
