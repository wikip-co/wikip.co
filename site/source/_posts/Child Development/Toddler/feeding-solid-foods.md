## Fruits

Here's a list of suitable fruits and how to prepare them:

- Bananas
  - Rich in potassium and fiber, bananas are easy to mash and are often a favorite among babies. Just peel and mash or cut into small, manageable pieces.
- Apples
  - Peel, core, and cook apples until they are soft. You can puree them or cut them into small, soft pieces.
- Pears
  - Like apples, pears should be peeled, cored, and cooked until soft. They can be pureed or offered in small pieces.
- Peaches and Nectarines
  - Choose ripe ones for their softness, peel, and mash or cut into small pieces.
- Plums
  - Soft, ripe plums can be peeled and mashed or cut into small pieces.
- Avocado
  - High in healthy fats, avocados are easily mashed and can be a good first fruit.
- Berries
  - Mash or cut into small pieces.
  - Strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries can be given, but ensure they are mashed well to avoid choking hazards.
- Melon
  - Watermelon
  - Cantaloupe
  - Honeydew
  - Can be cut into small pieces or mashed.
  - Remove all seeds.
- Mango
  - Peel and mash ripe mangoes, or cut them into small, soft pieces.
- Kiwi
  - Rich in vitamin C
  - Kiwi should be peeled and cut into small, soft pieces.
- Papaya
  - This fruit is soft and easy to mash, making it ideal for babies.

### Guidelines for Preparation

- Always peel fruits to make them easier to digest and to avoid choking hazards.
- Cook fruits that are harder in texture to soften them.
- Cut fruits into small, bite-sized pieces that your child can easily manage.
- Watch out for any allergic reactions, especially when introducing a new fruit.
  - Introduce one fruit at a time and wait a few days before introducing another to check for any allergic reactions.

1. **Size**: Pieces should be small enough to avoid choking but large enough for the baby to hold and manage. A good rule of thumb is to cut pieces about the size of your child's fingertip or a pea.

2. **Shape**: Aim for shapes that are easy to grasp and chew. This can vary depending on the fruit and its texture.

   - **Long, thin strips**: Good for fruits like melons, mangoes, or cooked apples. They should be short enough to prevent choking but long enough for the baby to hold onto one end while chewing the other.
     - When cutting fruits into long, thin strips for an 11-month-old, the thickness is an important consideration for both safety and ease of grasping. A general guideline is to cut the strips to be about as wide as an adult's pinky finger, which is typically around Â½ inch (about 1.25 cm) thick.
     - This size is small enough to reduce the risk of choking but still large enough for your baby to hold onto effectively, facilitating self-feeding. Remember, the fruit should be soft enough to be easily mashed with gums or baby teeth.
     - As always, closely supervise your child while they are eating to ensure they are safe and comfortable with the size of the food. Over time, as they develop better chewing and swallowing skills, you can adjust the size accordingly. 
   - **Small cubes or chunks**: Ideal for softer fruits like banana, peach, or ripe pear. Ensure the pieces are soft enough to be mashed with gums.
   - **Mashed or lightly pureed**: For fruits like avocado or banana, mashing them lightly with a fork can make them easier to eat. This can also work for berries.

3. **Softness**: Fruits should be soft enough to be mashed between your fingers. This ensures that even if your child swallows a piece whole, it won't pose a choking hazard.

4. **Peeling and Removing Seeds**: Always peel fruits to reduce choking risks and remove any seeds or pits.

5. **Cooking Harder Fruits**: For harder fruits like apples and pears, cooking them until soft and then cutting them into appropriate shapes can make them safer and easier to eat.

6. **Supervision**: Always supervise your child while they are eating to quickly address any issues if they struggle with a particular size or shape.

7. **Experimentation**: Each child is different, so you may need to experiment with sizes and shapes to see what your child prefers and handles best.

Remember, the goal is to make the pieces manageable for your child to pick up and chew without posing a choking hazard. As your child becomes more experienced with eating and develops better motor skills, you can gradually offer larger or differently shaped pieces.
