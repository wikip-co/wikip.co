### Projected Immunization Delivery Costs for 194 Countries, 2021â€“2030

- Scenario analyses were conducted, considering factors such as vaccine price changes, delivery costs, and buffer stock levels, to account for uncertainties in future costs.[^1]
- The average immunization cost per child across all countries is calculated to be $192.6.[^1]
- The total cost of the immunization program, including routine vaccines, routine delivery, and non-routine costs, is estimated to be $269.8 billion.[^1]
- The economic resources needed to achieve the Immunization Agenda 2030 (IA2030) in 194 WHO member countries from 2021 to 2030 requires massive resource mobilization and increased investment from country governments and donors.[^1]
The strategy for increasing investment from country governments and donors is essential to achieving Immunization Agenda 2030 and ensuring sustainable immunization programs.[^1]
