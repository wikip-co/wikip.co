## Background Info

The average immunization cost per child across all countries is $192.6. Total costs worldwide range up to $552.2 billion.[^1]

The incremental increase in cost of vaccination after 2020 was ~$89.9 billion.[^1]

The immunization program's cost to World Health Organization member countries is expected to increase during this decade.[^1]

The strategy for increasing investment from country governments and donors is essential to achieving Immunization Agenda 2030 and ensuring sustainable immunization programs.[^1]

### Maternally Acquired Antibodies

Humoral antibodies of the IgG class can cross the placenta from mother to foetus.[^3]

These antibodies will provide passive protection of the newborn against those diseases which involve humoral immunity and to which the mother is immune.[^3]

In this manner, most newborn infants in the UK will have passive protection against tetanus, but not against tuberculosis. Protection against the latter relies to a large extent on cell-mediated immunity.[^3]

Secreted (IgA) antibodies are also passed to the gut of a newborn, together with the first deliveries of breast milk (colostrum). Such antibodies provide some passive protection against infections of the gastrointestinal tract.[^3]

#### Interaction with Vaccines

Maternally acquired antibodies will react with antigens associated with an infection but also with antigens introduced to the body as part of an immunisation programme. Premature immunisation, that is, before degradation of the maternal antibodies, may reduce the potency of an administered vaccine.[^3]
