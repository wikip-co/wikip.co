## Background Info

### Maternally Acquired Antibodies

Humoral antibodies of the IgG class can cross the placenta from mother to foetus.[^3]

These antibodies will provide passive protection of the newborn against those diseases which involve humoral immunity and to which the mother is immune.[^3]

In this manner, most newborn infants in the UK will have passive protection against tetanus, but not against tuberculosis. Protection against the latter relies to a large extent on cell-mediated immunity.[^3]

Secreted (IgA) antibodies are also passed to the gut of a newborn, together with the first deliveries of breast milk (colostrum). Such antibodies provide some passive protection against infections of the gastrointestinal tract.[^3]

#### Interaction with Vaccines

Maternally acquired antibodies will react with antigens associated with an infection but also with antigens introduced to the body as part of an immunisation programme. Premature immunisation, that is, before degradation of the maternal antibodies, may reduce the potency of an administered vaccine.[^3]
