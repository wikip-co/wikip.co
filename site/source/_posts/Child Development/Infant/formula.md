Prebiotics are non-digestible ingredients that exert significant health-promoting effects on hosts.[^1]

## Galactooligosaccharides (GOS)

- Galactooligosaccharides (GOS) have remarkable prebiotic effects and structural similarity to human milk oligosaccharides.[^1]
- Galactooligosaccharides generally comprise two to eight sugar units, including galactose and glucose, which are synthesized from substrate lactose by microbial Î²-galactosidase.[^1]
- Enzyme sources from probiotics have received particular interest because of their safety and potential to synthesize specific structures that are particularly metabolized by intestinal probiotics.[^1]
- Owing to advancements in modern analytical techniques, many GOS structures have been identified, which vary in degree of polymerization, glycosidic linkage, and branch location.[^1]
- After intake, GOS adjust gut microbiota which produce short chain fatty acids, and exhibit excellent biological activities.[^1]
- They selectively stimulate the proliferation of probiotics, inhibit the growth and adhesion of pathogenic bacteria, alleviate gastrointestinal, neurological, metabolic and allergic diseases, modulate metabolites production, and adjust ion storage and absorption.[^1]
- Additionally, GOS are safe and stable, with high solubility and clean taste, and thus are widely used as food additives.[^1]
- GOS can improve the appearance, flavor, taste, texture, viscosity, rheological properties, shelf life, and health benefits of food products.[^1]
