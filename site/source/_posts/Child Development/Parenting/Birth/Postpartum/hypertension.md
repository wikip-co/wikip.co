## Description

Postpartum hypertension can be persistent, following a pregnancy complicated by hypertension, or new onset (de novo), following a normotensive pregnancy.

- Normotensive denotes having normal blood pressure.
  - Normal blood pressure should be less than 120/80
- A normotensive pregnancy is defined as having a steady decrease in BP up to 20 weeks of pregnancy, followed by an increase in BP up to delivery.

### Preeclampsia

Pre-eclampsia is one high blood pressure (hypertension) disorder that can occur during pregnancy. It usually begins after 20 weeks of pregnancy in a woman whose blood pressure had been normal. It can lead to serious, even fatal, complications for both mother and baby. There may be no symptoms.

#### Symptoms

- High blood pressure
- Protein in the urine. 
  - This condition can be a sign of kidney damage.
- There may also be swelling in the legs and water retention
  - This can be hard to distinguish from normal pregnancy.





#### Treatments

Pre-eclampsia can often be managed with oral or IV medications.

##### Nifedipine

Nifedipine was patented in 1967, and approved for use in the United States in 1981.

Nifedipine, sold under the brand name Adalat and Procardia, is a Dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker medication used to manage high blood pressure.  It acts as a potent vasodilator with little or no negative effect upon cardiac contractility or conduction. It may be used to treat severe high blood pressure in pregnancy. Nifedipine is taken by mouth and comes in fast- and slow-release formulations.

- There is tentative evidence that its use in pregnancy is safe; however, it is not recommended during breastfeeding.
- Its use in preterm labor may allow more time for steroids to improve the baby's lung function and provide time for transfer of the mother to a well qualified medical facility before delivery.
