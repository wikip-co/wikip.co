## Cervical lymphadenopathy

Cervical lymphadenopathy is abnormal enlargement of lymph nodes (LNs) in the head and neck usually >1 cm. Most cases are benign and self-limited, however, the differential diagnosis is broad.[^1]

Viral upper respiratory tract infection is the most common cause of cervical lymphadenopathy in children. These enlarged "reactive" nodes may persist for weeks to months.[^1]
