Every infant and child has the right to good nutrition according to the “Convention on the Rights of the Child.”[^1]

Exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months has many benefits for the infant and mother.[^1]

Primary among these is immunity against gastrointestinal infections which is observed not only in developing but also industrialized countries.[^1]

Early initiation of breastfeeding, within 1 hour of birth, protects the newborn from acquiring infections and reduces newborn mortality.[^1]

Breast milk is an important source of energy and nutrients in infants and newborns.[^1]

Breat milk can provide half of more of a child's energy needs.[^1]

Breast milk is enliving, nourishing, nutrition rich, congenial to human body, etc.[^1]

The breast milk can get vitiated (spoiled or impaired quality) due to items consumed by the mother, which in turn can affect the health of the child.[^1]

The mother should take proper care of herself which will help in formation of good quality of breast milk.[^1]

Breastfeeding may, in addition to the well-known passive protection against infections during lactation, have a unique capacity to stimulate the immune system of the offspring possibly with several long-term positive effects.[^1]
